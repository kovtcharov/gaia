# Autonomous Agent Mode — Design Specification

**Branch:** `feature/agent-always-running` (branch off `feature/agent-memory`)
**Status:** Draft v4 — aligned with OpenClaw Strategy
**Date:** 2026-04-01

> **Implementation status (2026-07):** `manual` and `goal_driven` are shipped
> and `goal_driven` is the default. The generic `autonomous` mode in the core UI
> loop is still gated (§6.7 observation cycle, [#2005](https://github.com/amd/gaia/issues/2005)),
> so the settings API rejects `agent_mode="autonomous"` there. **The Email
> Triage agent is the first concrete implementation of the observe→decide→act
> cycle**, on an earn-trust gradient with an inviolable confirm-floor and a
> closed correction→learning loop — see
> [`docs/plans/email-full-autonomy.mdx`](/plans/email-full-autonomy)
> (`autonomy_level = earn_trust`). Generalizing that engine back into the base
> `Agent` loop for every agent remains #2005; its first piece has landed —
> the empirical promotion gate (`TrustLedger` outcome counter + `TrustPolicy`
> scaffolding) now lives in `gaia.agents.base.trust_ledger`, and the email
> agent subclasses it.

## 1. Overview

GAIA agents are self-directed autonomous systems. Rather than waiting for the
user to send a message, the agent observes its environment, infers goals from
context, and works on them continuously — stopping only when it has nothing
left to do, is waiting for input, or has been paused.

**Strategic context:** This spec implements the *autonomy engine* component of
AMD's Agent Computer vision. The CES 2027 demo target is an agent that has
autonomously managed a developer's email, code reviews, infrastructure
monitoring, and daily briefs for 6 months — zero cloud costs, zero security
incidents, complete auditable local history. That target directly drives the
design decisions here.

GAIA's autonomous mode is AMD's answer to OpenClaw's heartbeat model, with a
critical differentiator: all goal data, memory, and activity logs stay on
device. Cloud agents cost $1–45/day per agent in API fees; GAIA's local-first
architecture makes that cost zero. Privacy-sensitive use cases (legal, medical,
financial) that are architecturally impossible for cloud agents are GAIA's
primary target.

The agent's behavior is controlled by a single `agent_mode` setting:

| Mode | Behaviour | Maps to |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `manual` | Classic request/response — no background activity | Chatbot |
| `goal_driven` | Executes user-approved goals in the background | Automation |
| `autonomous` | Observes environment, infers and executes its own goals | Agent |

Design default: `autonomous`; users can downgrade at any time from Settings.
(Until the observation cycle ships, the shipped default is `goal_driven` and
`autonomous` is not selectable — see the implementation-status note above.)

**What makes this genuinely autonomous (not just reactive):**
- In `autonomous` mode the agent runs an *observation cycle* on idle ticks
- It scans the environment (file system, git state, logs, conversation history,
  memory) and asks: *"What would a thoughtful expert do here without being
  asked?"*
- It creates goals from those observations with `source="agent_inferred"`
- If a matching permission grant exists in memory, the goal is auto-approved
- Otherwise the goal surfaces in the Goals dashboard as `pending_approval`
- The user can Approve / Reject / Always Accept each suggestion

This means the agent has genuine initiative. An empty goal queue on a fresh
install is not a no-op — the first idle tick reviews context and suggests goals.

The agent stops (or pauses) only when it:
- Has nothing to do and no observations yield new goals (`IDLE`)
- Is waiting for user input (`WAITING_INPUT`)
- Has self-scheduled a future wake-up (`SCHEDULED`)
- Has been explicitly paused by the user (`PAUSED`)

## 2. Design Goals

| # | Goal |
|---|------|
| G1 | Agent is self-directed: infers goals from observation, not just user instruction |
| G2 | Three modes (manual / goal_driven / autonomous) form a clear trust gradient |
| G3 | Agent-inferred goals always require user approval before execution |
| G4 | Permission grants (stored in MemoryStore) allow "always accept" approvals |
| G5 | Agent can ask the user questions without halting all other activity |
| G6 | Agent can self-schedule future wake-ups ("remind me in 10 min") |
| G7 | User can change mode from Settings UI at any time |
| G8 | All autonomous activity is visible, traceable, and auditable |
| G9 | System is safe: no destructive action without live user approval regardless of mode |
| G10 | GoalStore is separate from MemoryStore — work queue must not be LLM-rewritten |
| G11 | Private sessions are never touched by the autonomous loop |
| G12 | Memory/MemoryStore cannot be used as a prompt injection vector |
| G13 | Hybrid model routing: lightweight model for observation/classification, full model for execution — keeps per-tick cost near zero |
| G14 | All goal data, task history, and audit logs stay on-device — never transmitted to cloud |
| G15 | Prioritise use cases at the always-on × sensitive-data intersection: email, infrastructure, documents, home automation |

                               RUNNING
```

### State Transitions

| From | Event | To |
|------|-------|----|
| `RUNNING` | `set_loop_state("idle")` | `IDLE` → sleep until trigger → `RUNNING` |
| `RUNNING` | `request_user_input()` called | `WAITING_INPUT` |
| `RUNNING` | `set_loop_state("scheduled", N)` | `SCHEDULED` → sleep N secs → `RUNNING` |
| `RUNNING` | `agent_mode` set to `"manual"` | `PAUSED` |
| `RUNNING` | step budget exhausted (see §7.3) | `IDLE` (forced, logged) |
| `WAITING_INPUT` | user responds | `RUNNING` |
| `WAITING_INPUT` | timeout + `continue_if_no_response=true` | `RUNNING` |
| `WAITING_INPUT` | timeout + `continue_if_no_response=false` | `PAUSED` |
| `IDLE` | user sends message | `RUNNING` |
| `IDLE` | tick interval fires | `RUNNING` (only if approved goals exist) |
| `SCHEDULED` | scheduled time reached | `RUNNING` |
| `PAUSED` | `agent_mode` set to `"goal_driven"` or `"autonomous"` | `RUNNING` |

**Important:** `IDLE` does not loop unconditionally on every tick. The loop
only fires a new run if there are approved, pending goals in GoalStore
(`status="queued"`, `approved_for_auto=True`).
If none exist, the tick checks once and immediately sleeps again. This
prevents idle LLM calls when the agent truly has nothing to do.

---

## 4. Event-Driven Trigger Queue (Not a Polling Timer)

The loop is **event-driven**, not tick-based. Triggers wake the agent:

```
Trigger sources:
  ├── user_message       — user sends a chat message (always fires)
  ├── scheduled          — agent called set_loop_state("scheduled", N)
  ├── idle_tick          — periodic check (only if pending goals exist)
  └── external_event     — Phase 2: file change, webhook, etc.
```

After each agent run completes:
1. Check if the run produced more approved work (agent created new goals)
2. If yes → immediately re-trigger (no sleep)
3. If no → go IDLE, sleep until next trigger

```python
async def _process_trigger(self, trigger: AgentTrigger):
    while True:
        result = await self._run_step(trigger)
        match result.directive:
            case "idle":
                break                         # nothing more to do
            case "scheduled":
                self.schedule_at(result.wake_at); break
            case "waiting_input":
                break                         # loop resumes via resolve_user_input
            case "continue":
                trigger = AgentTrigger("continuation", result)
                # immediately loop — no sleep needed
```

**Tick interval** (for idle_tick): 60 seconds (configurable via
`GAIA_AGENT_TICK_INTERVAL` env var). The tick only fires a run if
`db.count_pending_autonomous_goals() > 0`.

---

## 5. Key Components

### 5.1 `AgentLoop` (`src/gaia/ui/agent_loop.py`)

```
AgentLoop
├── start(db, app_state)     — launch background task
├── stop()                   — graceful shutdown
├── notify_user_message(sid) — called by chat router on every user msg
├── schedule_tick(delay)     — accelerate next idle-tick
├── submit_user_input(rid, r)— called by /api/chat/user-input endpoint
├── _trigger_queue           — asyncio.Queue of AgentTrigger
├── _loop()                  — main coroutine: drain queue → _process_trigger
└── _run_step(trigger)       — find session, acquire locks, run agent tick
```

**Active session selection:**
- Select most recently updated non-private session
- Skip sessions where `session.private = true` — **always, unconditionally**
- Skip sessions with no approved pending goals (avoids pointless LLM calls)

**Startup gate:** The loop does not process triggers until after the
initialized marker exists (`~/.gaia/chat/initialized`). On first launch,
no autonomous ticks fire until onboarding completes.

**Tunnel gate:** If `app.state.tunnel.active` is True, the loop is
**suspended** — no background ticks fire. The user may re-enable via an
explicit override (`GAIA_AUTONOMOUS_ALLOW_TUNNEL=1`). This prevents remote
code injection through the tunnel API.

### 5.1.1 Hybrid Model Routing

The agent loop uses different model tiers for different operations to keep
per-tick cost near zero on local hardware:

| Operation | Model tier | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Observation cycle (scan + classify) | `Qwen3-0.6B` or `Qwen3-4B` | Fast, cheap — most ticks find nothing |
| Goal inference prompt | `Qwen3-4B` | Needs reasoning but not full capability |
| Goal execution (actual work) | `Qwen3.5-35B` (full agent model) | Quality matters; destructive potential |
| User input requests + confirmations | `Qwen3.5-35B` | User-facing; must be coherent |

This mirrors the OpenClaw heartbeat economics: routing routine classification
to local small models makes always-on operation sustainable. The 35B model
only loads when there is real work to execute.

Model selection is configured via `GAIA_AUTO_OBSERVE_MODEL` (default:
`Qwen3-4B-GGUF`) and falls back to the agent's primary model if the
lightweight model is unavailable.

### 5.2 `set_loop_state` Tool (replaces "respond with IDLE")

The agent signals its intent explicitly via a registered tool rather than
returning a magic string. This is reliable regardless of model size.

```python
@tool
def set_loop_state(
    self,
    state: str,          # "idle" | "scheduled" | "paused"
    reason: str = "",
    wake_in_seconds: int = 0,   # required when state="scheduled"
) -> str:
    """Signal the autonomous loop what to do next.

    Call this when you have finished all current work or need to pause.

    Args:
        state: "idle"      — nothing more to do right now; loop will check
                             again at the next tick interval.
               "scheduled" — wake me up in wake_in_seconds seconds.
               "paused"    — stop the autonomous loop (requires user action
                             to restart).
        reason: Human-readable explanation (shown in activity log).
        wake_in_seconds: Seconds until next wake-up (only for "scheduled").
                         Minimum: 30. Maximum: 86400 (24 hours).
    """
```

**Constraints enforced in the tool implementation:**
- `wake_in_seconds` floor: 30 seconds (prevents infinite loops)
- `wake_in_seconds` ceiling: 86400 seconds (prevents absurdly far scheduling)
- If `wake_in_seconds` is below floor, clamp to 30 and log a warning

### 5.3 `request_user_input` Tool

Allows the agent to pause and ask the user a question via the SSE stream.

```python
@tool
def request_user_input(
    self,
    message: str,
    choices: Optional[List[str]] = None,      # show buttons instead of text field
    default_if_no_response: Optional[str] = None,  # returned on timeout
    timeout_seconds: int = 300,
    continue_if_no_response: bool = True,
) -> str:
    """Ask the user a question and wait for their response.

    Args:
        message: The question to present to the user.
        choices: Optional list of choices (renders as buttons in the UI).
        default_if_no_response: Value to use if no response received before
            timeout. If not set and continue_if_no_response=True, returns
            the sentinel string "__NO_RESPONSE__". Callers must check for
            this value and handle it explicitly — never proceed blindly.
        timeout_seconds: How long to wait (min 10, default 300).
        continue_if_no_response: If True, continue working after timeout.
            If False, the loop pauses until user re-engages.

    Returns:
        User's response string, chosen option, or "__NO_RESPONSE__" if
        timed out and no default was provided. ALWAYS check the return value.
    """
```

**Return value contract:**
- User responded: returns their text or chosen option
- Timeout + `default_if_no_response` set: returns the default
- Timeout + no default + `continue_if_no_response=True`: returns `"__NO_RESPONSE__"`
- Never returns empty string `""` — this prevents silent blind-proceed bugs

**Callers must handle `"__NO_RESPONSE__"` explicitly:**
```python
response = self.request_user_input("Which folder?", default_if_no_response="~/Documents")
# response is always a real value here — default used on timeout
```
```python
response = self.request_user_input("Confirm deletion?", continue_if_no_response=True)
if response == "__NO_RESPONSE__":
    self.set_loop_state("idle", reason="Awaiting user confirmation before delete")
    return  # do NOT proceed
```

**Input request queue:** Multiple concurrent requests are supported.
`SSEOutputHandler` maintains an ordered `deque` of pending requests rather
than a single slot. Each request has a unique `request_id`. The frontend
renders all pending requests; each is resolved independently by `request_id`.

### 5.4 Background Mode: Destructive Tool Handling

When a tick runs in the background (no user actively watching), any tool
in the agent's confirmation set (`confirmation_required_tools()` — the
generic base set merged with the agent's own `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED_TOOLS`)
behaves differently:

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| User-initiated (SSE open) | Show overlay, wait 60s, deny on timeout |
| Background tick (no active SSE) | **Immediately deny** — no waiting |

On immediate deny, the agent receives:
```
"Tool '[tool_name]' requires live user approval and cannot run unattended.
 Use request_user_input() to notify the user and ask them to approve,
 then retry in a subsequent turn."
```

This prevents the background loop from holding the semaphore for 60-second
stretches and prevents silent retry storms.

**How to detect background context:** `SSEOutputHandler` gains a
`background_mode: bool` flag, set to `True` by `AgentLoop._run_step()`.
`confirm_tool_execution()` checks this flag and short-circuits.

### 5.5 `SSEOutputHandler` Changes (`src/gaia/ui/sse_handler.py`)

```python
class SSEOutputHandler(OutputHandler):
    def __init__(self, background_mode: bool = False):
        ...
        self.background_mode = background_mode
        # User input request queue (ordered, multi-slot)
        self._user_input_queue: deque = deque()
        # Per-request events: request_id -> threading.Event
        self._user_input_events: dict = {}
        self._user_input_results: dict = {}

    def confirm_tool_execution(self, tool_name, tool_args, timeout=60) -> bool:
        if self.background_mode:
            # Immediate deny — no waiting, no semaphore hold
            self._emit({
                "type": "tool_confirm_denied",
                "tool": tool_name,
                "reason": "unattended",
                "message": f"'{tool_name}' requires live user approval.",
            })
            return False
        # ... existing blocking logic unchanged ...

    def request_user_input(self, message, choices=None,
                           default_if_no_response=None,
                           timeout=300, continue_if_no_response=True) -> str:
        ...  # uses _user_input_queue, not single-slot fields

    def resolve_user_input(self, request_id: str, response: str) -> bool:
        ...  # looks up by request_id in _user_input_events
```

### 5.6 Path Access in Background Mode

`PathValidator.is_path_allowed()` accepts a `prompt_user: bool` parameter.
`AgentLoop` **always calls with `prompt_user=False`**. This means:

- Out-of-scope path access is **denied silently** in background mode
- The agent receives `"Access denied: path outside allowed directories"`
- The agent can use `request_user_input` to ask the user to expand permissions

`PathValidator` also enforces: background mode (non-interactive) calls
**never** invoke `_prompt_user_for_access()`, which calls `input()` and
would deadlock the server thread (no stdin in background).

Additionally: background ticks **do not expand `allowed_paths`** at runtime.
The `[always]` option in the path prompt persists to disk —  this is too
powerful for unattended use. Path expansion is only permitted in interactive
(user-present) sessions.

---

## 6. GoalStore — Structured Work Queue (separate from MemoryStore)

### 6.1 Architecture

Goals and tasks live in **GoalStore** (`src/gaia/agents/base/goal_store.py`),
not in MemoryStore. This separation is intentional:

| Store | Purpose | LLM can rewrite? |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `MemoryStore` | Knowledge base — facts, preferences, skills, profile | Yes (consolidate/reconcile) |
| `GoalStore` | Work queue — goals and tasks with state machines | No — structured tools only |

LLM consolidation must never merge two goals or rewrite task status.
Keeping them separate makes this impossible by design.

When a goal completes, GoalStore writes a summary back to MemoryStore as a
`fact` entry so the agent builds long-term knowledge from its work history.

### 6.2 Goal hierarchy

```
Goal  (high-level objective)
└── Task[]  (discrete, completable steps in order)
    └── result: str  (what was done / outcome)
```

Two levels is the right depth. Goals are objectives ("Refactor auth module");
tasks are work items ("Extract JWT validation", "Write tests", "Update docs").

### 6.3 Goal state machine

```
[agent_inferred] ──► pending_approval ──► queued ──► in_progress ──► completed
                                      └──► rejected               └──► failed
[user / scheduled] ─────────────────► queued                     └──► cancelled
                                           └──► cancelled
```

### 6.4 Task state machine

```
queued ──► in_progress ──► completed
     └──► blocked ──────► in_progress (unblocked)
                       └──► failed / cancelled
```

### 6.5 Goal sources and approval

| `source` | Default status | `approved_for_auto` | Who approves |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|-|
| `user` | `queued` | `True` | Implicit — user created it |
| `agent_inferred` | `pending_approval` | `False` | User must explicitly approve |
| `agent_scheduled` | `queued` | `True` | Inherited from parent goal |

Agent-inferred goals surface in the Goals dashboard as a **pending approval
banner** with three actions:
- **Reject** → status = `rejected`, never executed
- **Accept** → `approved_for_auto = True`, status = `queued`
- **Always Accept** → Accept + store a permission grant in MemoryStore

### 6.6 Permission grants (MemoryStore `"permission"` category)

"Always Accept" stores a natural-language permission grant:

```python
memory_store.store(
    content="User always accepts goals related to code review and refactoring",
    category="permission",
    source="user",
)
```

Before surfacing an agent-inferred goal for approval, the agent checks:
```
Does this goal's description semantically match any stored permission grant?
```
If yes → auto-approve. If no → show approval banner.

The permission check uses the existing FAISS vector search — no separate
rules engine is needed.

### 6.7 Observation cycle (autonomous mode only)

In `autonomous` mode, the agent's idle tick runs an **observation cycle**
rather than only checking for existing approved goals.

**Observation uses a lightweight model** (Qwen3-0.6B or Qwen3-4B) for the
classification and inference step, reserving the full 35B model for actual
goal execution. This makes observation ticks near-zero cost — the difference
between $1–3/day (cloud heartbeat) and essentially free on local hardware.

```
Sensors polled on each idle tick (extensible; shipped in priority order):

  Phase 1 — Core (always-on × sensitive-data intersection):
  • Email monitor        — unread/flagged messages, action items, follow-ups
  • Git monitor          — new commits, failing CI, open PRs, stale branches
  • Error log scan       — recurring errors, new stack traces, warnings
  • Conversation scan    — implicit goals from recent messages
  • Memory review        — patterns suggesting work worth doing
  • System state         — disk usage, process health, memory pressure

  Phase 2 — Extended (plug-in architecture):
  • Home Assistant events — automations triggered, devices in error state
  • File watcher          — documents modified since last tick
  • Calendar scan         — upcoming meetings needing prep, overdue tasks
  • Messaging adapters    — Telegram, Discord, Slack action items

Observation inference prompt (lightweight model):
  "Observe the following signals from the user's environment: [observations].
   Identify up to 3 high-value goals a thoughtful expert would pursue without
   being asked. Prioritise: (1) always-on tasks — things that need monitoring
   or continuous attention; (2) sensitive/private tasks — things the user
   would not want processed by a cloud service.
   For each goal: title, description, confidence (0–1), safe_to_auto_execute."
```

Goals with `confidence >= 0.8` and `safe_to_auto_execute=true` are checked
against permission grants and may be auto-approved. Everything else surfaces
for user review.

Most inferences are obvious — failing tests, unread email flagged for follow-up,
stale TODOs, outdated docs. The agent acts on these without asking. Ambiguous
or high-risk actions surface for approval.

### 6.8 Memory injection mitigation

The autonomous loop prompt is goal-driven, not memory-driven:

```
You are running autonomously. Retrieve your approved pending goals:
  goal_store.get_actionable_goals()

Work on the highest-priority goal. Break it into tasks if not already done.
Execute each task in order using your tools.

For any destructive operation (delete, overwrite, shell command, external
API call), you MUST use request_user_input() — never proceed without
confirmation, regardless of agent mode.

When all goals are complete (or no goals remain), call set_loop_state("idle").
```

Injected `reminder` / `note` / `fact` entries are **never** treated as
executable commands. Only `GoalStore` entries with `approved_for_auto=True`
drive execution. Memory categories cannot be goal-hijacked because goals no
longer live in MemoryStore.

## 7. Session History — Background Ticks Are Not User Messages

### 7.1 New Message Role: `autonomous`

The database gains a fourth message role alongside `user`, `assistant`,
`system`:

```sql
-- messages.role CHECK constraint updated to include 'autonomous'
role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(role IN ('user', 'assistant', 'system', 'autonomous'))
```

Background tick prompts are stored with `role="autonomous"`:
- Included in conversation history sent to the LLM (the agent needs context)
- **Excluded** from the UI message list (user never sees raw tick prompts)
- Excluded from session exports
- Visible only in the Activity Log (§9)

The assistant's response to an autonomous tick is stored as `role="assistant"`
with an `activity_id` field linking it to the audit log entry. The UI can
optionally show these with a visual tag ("Agent acted autonomously").

### 7.2 Conversation History Injection

When building history pairs for the LLM, `_build_history_pairs()` includes
autonomous turns like this:

```python
# autonomous turns appear as [SYSTEM] prefixed user messages in context
{"role": "user", "content": "[AUTONOMOUS TICK] " + tick_prompt}
{"role": "assistant", "content": agent_response}
```

A rolling window cap applies: at most 5 recent autonomous turns are included
in history, preventing context window saturation from repeated ticks.

### 7.3 Step Budget and Rate Limiting

| Limit | Default | Config key |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Max steps per autonomous tick | 20 | `GAIA_AUTO_MAX_STEPS` |
| Max autonomous ticks per hour | 30 | `GAIA_AUTO_MAX_TICKS_PER_HOUR` |
| Max agent-created goals per day | 10 | `GAIA_AUTO_MAX_GOALS_PER_DAY` |
| Min schedule interval | 30s | hardcoded |
| Max schedule lookahead | 86400s | hardcoded |

When `max_steps` is reached mid-tick, the agent is forced to `IDLE` and a
warning is added to the activity log: "Tick exceeded step budget — partially
completed work may need review."

When the hourly rate limit is hit, all further ticks are suppressed and a
notification is shown in the UI: "Autonomous loop rate-limited — check
activity log."

---

## 8. Audit Log & Traceability (Phase 1 Requirement)

Every autonomous action must be traceable. This is **not** a Phase 3 nice-
to-have — it is a Phase 1 requirement. Users must be able to see exactly
what the agent did without asking, especially for anything affecting files
or memory.

### 8.1 Activity Log — SQLite Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS autonomous_activity (
    id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,       -- UUID
    session_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
    trigger     TEXT NOT NULL,          -- "user_message"|"scheduled"|"idle_tick"
    trigger_goal_id TEXT,               -- memory entry ID that triggered this run
    started_at  TEXT NOT NULL,          -- ISO 8601
    ended_at    TEXT,
    outcome     TEXT,                   -- "completed"|"idle"|"scheduled"|"error"|"rate_limited"
    steps_taken INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    tools_called TEXT,                  -- JSON array of tool names used
    files_read  TEXT,                   -- JSON array of file paths
    files_written TEXT,                 -- JSON array of file paths
    memory_read TEXT,                   -- JSON array of memory IDs queried
    memory_written TEXT,                -- JSON array of memory IDs created/updated
    user_input_requests TEXT,           -- JSON array of request_user_input calls
    error_message TEXT,
    message_id  INTEGER,                -- FK to messages table (agent's response)
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_session ON autonomous_activity(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_started ON autonomous_activity(started_at DESC);
```

### 8.2 Activity REST API

```
GET  /api/agent/activity?session_id=&limit=20&offset=0
     → { activities: [...], total: N }

GET  /api/agent/activity/{activity_id}
     → full activity record

DELETE /api/agent/activity/{activity_id}
     → 204 (admin cleanup only)
```

### 8.3 Activity UI

The chat sidebar gains an "Activity" tab (or footer link). It shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent Activity                                     │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  ✓ 14:32  Summarised Q1 report (3 tools, 8 steps)  │
│  ✓ 14:01  Set reminder for weekly review            │
│  ⏸ 13:55  Awaiting approval: delete ~/tmp/*.log    │
│  ✗ 13:20  Rate limited (30 ticks/hr reached)        │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  [View full log]                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Expanding an entry shows: trigger, goal that was worked on, each tool call
with args and result summary, files touched, memory entries created.

---

## 9. HTTP Endpoint: User Input Response

```
POST /api/chat/user-input
{
  "session_id": "sess_abc",
  "request_id": "uuid4-from-sse-event",
  "response":   "~/Documents/Reports"
}
→ 200 { "status": "ok", "request_id": "..." }
→ 404 if no active SSE handler for session
→ 409 if request_id not found in the pending queue
```

---

## 10. Settings

| Key | Type | Default | Storage |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `agent_mode` | `"manual"` \| `"goal_driven"` \| `"autonomous"` | `"autonomous"` | SQLite settings table |

```
GET  /api/settings  → { "agent_mode": "autonomous", ... }
PUT  /api/settings  { "agent_mode": "goal_driven" }
```

**Mode transitions:**
- Downgrading (`autonomous` → `goal_driven` → `manual`) immediately
  transitions the loop to `PAUSED` after the current step completes.
- Upgrading (`manual` → `goal_driven` → `autonomous`) fires the trigger
  queue immediately.
- In `manual` mode the AgentLoop is fully dormant — zero LLM calls.
- In `goal_driven` mode the observation cycle is skipped; only existing
  approved GoalStore entries are executed.
- In `autonomous` mode the observation cycle runs on every idle tick.

The old `always_running: bool` setting is removed. The UI Settings panel
shows a three-way toggle: **Manual | Goal-driven | Autonomous**.

---

## 11. Private Sessions

Sessions with `private=True` are **never touched by the autonomous loop**,
unconditionally. This applies to:
- Active session selection in `_get_active_session()` — skipped entirely
- The `notify_user_message()` trigger — if the session is private, no
  autonomous continuation fires after the agent responds
- The activity log — no entries for private sessions

This is enforced at the `AgentLoop` level, not just the settings level.
Even with `agent_mode="autonomous"`, private sessions are never autonomously
processed.

---

## 12. Tunnel Safety

When `app.state.tunnel.active` is `True`:

1. The `AgentLoop` suspends all idle-tick firing
2. User-message triggers still fire (the user is actively interacting)
3. Goals created via the tunnel API are created with `approved_for_auto=False`
   regardless of the request payload
4. To re-enable autonomous idle-ticks over the tunnel, the user must set
   `GAIA_AUTONOMOUS_ALLOW_TUNNEL=1` in their environment

---

## 13. User-Message → Autonomous Continuation

When a user sends a message and the agent responds, if `agent_mode != "manual"`:

1. Chat router calls `agent_loop.notify_user_message(session_id)` after response
2. `AgentLoop` enqueues a `AgentTrigger("user_message_followup", session_id)`
3. On the next loop iteration, agent checks for approved pending goals
4. If goals exist → continues working autonomously
5. If no goals → immediately goes `IDLE` (no LLM call)

This means "always running" applies to the entire agent lifecycle, not just
background ticks. A user saying "summarise all my Q1 docs" gets a response,
then the agent immediately continues on the next goal without the user having
to send another message.

---

## 14. Time Awareness

The agent needs current time for scheduling. `system_context.py` (already
on the `feature/agent-memory` branch) injects a `system_context` block into
every autonomous tick's context:

```python
# Prepended to the autonomous tick prompt:
f"Current date/time: {datetime.now().isoformat()}\n"
f"Timezone: {tzlocal.get_localzone_name()}\n"
```

This allows the agent to reason: "the user asked me to check back at 3pm —
that's 2 hours 14 minutes from now → SCHEDULE:8040".

---

## 15. Visual Distinction: Autonomous vs User-Prompted Messages

Messages produced by autonomous ticks have an `activity_id` field in the DB.
The UI renders these with:
- A small "⚡ Autonomous" badge beneath the assistant message
- A link to the activity log entry ("3 tools · 8 steps")
- Slightly different background shade (configurable via CSS variable)

This ensures users always know whether the agent was responding to them or
acting on its own initiative.

## 16. Frontend Changes

### 16.1 Settings Modal — Agent Behavior Section

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent Behavior                                     │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  Always Running                          [ ON ]     │
│  Agent works on approved goals automatically.       │
│  Disable to respond only when you send a message.  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 16.2 User Input Request Card

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚡ Agent needs your input                          │
│  (Working on: "Summarise Q1 reports")               │
│                                                     │
│  "Which directory should I save the output?"       │
│                                                     │
│  [~/Documents]  [~/Desktop]  [Other...]            │  ← choices buttons
│   ── or ──                                         │
│  [___________________________]  [ Send ]            │
│                                                     │
│  ⏱ 4:32 remaining · will use default if no reply  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- `choices` renders as buttons (fast selection, no typing needed)
- Timer countdown from `timeout_seconds`
- "will use default if no reply" only shown when `default_if_no_response` set
- Multiple cards stack if agent asks several questions in sequence
- Each resolves independently; resolved cards collapse with the user's answer

### 16.3 Permission Request Overlay (Autonomous Context)

When a destructive tool fires during autonomous execution, the overlay shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚡ Agent Action — Autonomous                       │
│                                                     │
│  Working on: "Clean up ~/tmp directory"            │  ← goal context
│  Wants to run: run_shell_command                    │
│  Command: rm -rf ~/tmp/*.log                        │
│                                                     │
│  [ Allow ]    [ Deny ]    [ View Activity Log ]    │
│                                                     │
│  ⏱ 58s remaining                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The `permission_request` SSE event gains two new fields:
- `triggered_by: str` — goal/task ID or "user_message"
- `task_context: str` — human-readable description of what the agent was doing

### 16.4 New Types

```typescript
// StreamEventType additions
| 'user_input_request'   // agent needs user input
| 'agent_loop_status'    // loop state changed (running/idle/scheduled/paused)
| 'tool_confirm_denied'  // tool denied immediately (background mode)

// StreamEvent additions
request_id?: string;
continue_if_no_response?: boolean;
choices?: string[];
default_if_no_response?: string;
// permission_request additions:
triggered_by?: string;
task_context?: string;

// UserInputRequest interface
interface UserInputRequest {
    requestId: string;
    message: string;
    choices?: string[];
    defaultIfNoResponse?: string;
    timeoutSeconds: number;
    continueIfNoResponse: boolean;
    expiresAt: number;   // Date.now() + timeoutSeconds * 1000
}
```

### 16.5 Chat Store Updates

```typescript
pendingUserInputRequests: UserInputRequest[];
addUserInputRequest:    (req: UserInputRequest) => void;
removeUserInputRequest: (requestId: string)     => void;
```

---

## 17. AgentLoop + Concurrency Controls

```python
async def _run_step(self, trigger: AgentTrigger, session: dict):
    semaphore = self._app_state.chat_semaphore
    session_locks = self._app_state.session_locks
    sid = session["id"]

    # Background ticks: skip if busy (don't queue)
    # User-message followup: wait up to 10s (user is actively present)
    timeout = 10.0 if trigger.source == "user_message_followup" else 3.0
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(semaphore.acquire(), timeout=timeout)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        logger.debug("AgentLoop: server busy, skipping trigger %s", trigger.source)
        return

    try:
        session_lock = session_locks.setdefault(sid, asyncio.Lock())
        try:
            await asyncio.wait_for(session_lock.acquire(), timeout=2.0)
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            semaphore.release()
            return
        try:
            sse_handler = SSEOutputHandler(background_mode=True)
            await self._stream_autonomous_prompt(session, sse_handler)
        finally:
            session_lock.release()
    finally:
        semaphore.release()
```

- [ ] "Agent paused" banner when `agent_mode="manual"`
- [ ] Configurable budgets via Settings UI

### Phase 3 — Advanced Autonomy

- [ ] External event triggers (file change, webhook)
- [ ] Multi-session loop (priority ordering)
- [ ] Push notifications for significant completions
- [ ] Cron-like scheduled tasks in memory

---

## 19. Security Summary

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| `input()` deadlock in background | `prompt_user=False` enforced in all AgentLoop path checks |
| Tool confirm timeout (60s semaphore hold) | `background_mode=True` → immediate deny, no wait |
| Memory injection / command injection | Goals require `approved_for_auto=True`; injected reminders/notes never executed |
| Session history pollution | Tick prompts stored as `role="autonomous"`, hidden from UI |
| Unbounded LLM calls | Per-tick step budget + hourly rate limit + daily goal limit |
| No audit trail | `autonomous_activity` table is a Phase 1 requirement |
| PathValidator `[always]` expansion | Background mode never calls `_prompt_user_for_access()` |
| SCHEDULE:1 infinite loop | `wake_in_seconds` clamped to [30, 86400] |
| Tunnel → remote code injection | Loop suspended when tunnel active; tunnel goal API always creates with `approved_for_auto=False` |
| Multi-slot user input race | `deque`-based queue, resolved by `request_id` |
| Goal/task data in MemoryStore (LLM-rewritable) | Goals and tasks live in GoalStore (separate SQLite DB, structured API only) — LLM consolidation cannot touch work-queue state |
| `allowed_paths` defaults to `~` | Background ticks enforce read-only unless explicit write scope |
| Empty-string blind proceed | Returns `"__NO_RESPONSE__"` sentinel; callers must check |
| Confirm overlay lacks context | `triggered_by` + `task_context` fields on `permission_request` event |
| Private session exposure | Private sessions unconditionally excluded from all loop operations |

---

## 20. Open Questions

1. **Autonomous turn history cap**: 5 recent turns seems right but needs
   empirical testing. Too few → agent loses context of what it just did.
   Too many → context window saturation for long-running autonomous sessions.

2. **Goal approval UX**: Where should unapproved agent-created goals appear?
   Options: inline in chat ("I'd like to also do X — approve?"), a dedicated
   "Pending Goals" panel, or a notification badge. Inline feels most natural
   but could be annoying if the agent suggests many goals.

3. **`agent_mode` default for new installations**: Starting with `"autonomous"`
   on a clean install (no goals in GoalStore) means the first few ticks fire,
   find nothing, go idle, and stop. That's low-cost and correct — but may
   surprise users who haven't opted in to autonomous mode. Consider:
   `agent_mode` defaults to `"manual"` until after first-boot onboarding
   is complete, then auto-enables to `"autonomous"`.

4. **Autonomous history in exports**: Should session exports include
   autonomous turns? They're part of the conversation context but were never
   visible in the UI. Proposal: include them in a separate appendix section
   of the export, clearly labelled.

## 21. Strategic Context — AMD OpenClaw

This section records why certain design decisions were made, grounded in
AMD's internal "OpenClaw Strategy" — AMD's answer to the AI agent era.

### 21.1 The Three-Track Framework

OpenClaw identifies three tracks for AMD in the AI agent era:

| Track | Description | GAIA's Role |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Integrate** | Embed AI into AMD's existing software ecosystem | AgentSDK as the integration surface |
| **Build** | Build the agent infrastructure layer locally | Autonomous agent loop, GoalStore, local LLM |
| **Cloud** | Offer AMD cloud-backed inference for bursty workloads | Hybrid routing; escalate to cloud when needed |

GAIA's autonomous mode is the "Build" track in action: a complete local
agent infrastructure that needs no cloud backend for core operation.

### 21.2 The Heartbeat Cost Problem

Cloud agent frameworks charge per LLM call. An always-on agent that
checks in every 5 minutes burns roughly:

- Light workload (GPT-4o-mini, 500 tokens/tick): ~$1/day
- Medium workload (GPT-4o, 2000 tokens/tick): ~$8/day
- Heavy workload (GPT-4 Turbo, 5000 tokens/tick): ~$45/day

GAIA's hybrid routing model (§5.1.1) solves this directly:
- Observation ticks use Qwen3-0.6B (≈0.6B params, runs on NPU, cost: $0)
- Only execution ticks that require real intelligence escalate to 35B
- The daily observation cost is **zero** for local-only users

This is GAIA's primary competitive moat against OpenAI's Operator, Anthropic's
Computer Use, and Google's Project Astra — all of which require cloud API calls
for every tick.

### 21.3 "Power of Presence" — The Always-On Differentiator

OpenClaw's "Power of Presence" framework observes that the most valuable
AI agents are the ones that are *already there* when a problem occurs —
not the ones you have to invoke after the fact.

This directly motivates the observation cycle (§6.7): the agent is not
waiting for a user prompt. It is continuously scanning the environment and
asking "what would a thoughtful expert do here without being asked?" The
goal is an agent that notices a failing CI pipeline, a stale PR, or an
anomalous log entry — and begins working on it before the user even wakes up.

For GAIA, "Power of Presence" + local execution = a private always-on
expert with zero data egress, zero API costs, and full auditability.

### 21.4 Privacy-Sensitive Use Cases

Cloud agents face a structural barrier in regulated industries: data
cannot leave the device. GAIA's local-first architecture removes this
barrier entirely. Target verticals:

- **Legal**: contract review, deadline tracking, opposing counsel research
- **Medical**: patient note summarization, referral drafting, protocol checks
- **Financial**: portfolio monitoring, compliance flag detection, report drafting
- **Security**: log triage, CVE monitoring, incident response drafting

These use cases are architecturally impossible for cloud-only agents.
They are GAIA's exclusive territory.

### 21.5 CES 2027 Demo Target

The CES 2027 demo objective (per OpenClaw): an agent that has autonomously
managed a developer's email, code reviews, infrastructure monitoring, and
daily briefs **for 6 months** — with:
- Zero cloud costs
- Zero security incidents
- Complete auditable local history
- Running on a single Ryzen AI PC

This spec is the foundation for that demo. The implementation sequence
(`feature/agent-memory` → `feature/agent-always-running`) is designed to
reach a demoable autonomous loop by mid-2026 with 12 months of hardening
before CES 2027.
