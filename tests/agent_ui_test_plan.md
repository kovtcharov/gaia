# GAIA Agent UI — Conversational Test Plan

> **Purpose:** Validate the GAIA ChatAgent end-to-end through the Agent UI. Each test case is a multi-turn conversational snippet that a real user would type. The agent's responses should be evaluated for correctness, tool usage, OS awareness, and graceful error handling.
>
> **System Under Test:** `gaia chat --ui` (FastAPI backend + React frontend)
>
> **Prerequisites:**
> - Lemonade Server running with a loaded model (e.g., Qwen3-Coder-30B)
> - Embedding model loaded (e.g., user.embeddinggemma-300m-GGUF)
> - Agent UI started (`gaia chat --ui`)
> - Test fixture files placed in `tests/fixtures/agent_ui/` (see Appendix A)

## 19. Gap Analysis — Additional Test Cases

> **These test cases were identified through code review of the agent's tool implementations,
> error recovery paths, and boundary conditions not covered in sections 1-18.**

### TC-19.1: Retrieval Sufficiency Evaluation

> **Tests the `evaluate_retrieval` tool — a heuristic that decides if RAG results are good enough to answer a question, or if fallback searches are needed.**

```
User: Index the file CONTRIBUTING.md

Agent: [Should index the file successfully]

User: What is the required Python version for contributors?

Agent: [Should query_documents, then internally call evaluate_retrieval to assess
        if the retrieved chunks actually contain version info.
        If keyword_overlap < 0.3 → should try alternative searches
        If keyword_overlap > 0.5 → should answer with high confidence]

User: What is the policy on submitting patches for Windows-only bugs?

Agent: [Should query, evaluate_retrieval may return sufficient=False since this
        is a very specific question. Agent should gracefully say the document
        doesn't cover this topic rather than hallucinate an answer]
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Agent uses evaluate_retrieval internally (visible in tool call logs)
- [ ] Low-confidence results trigger fallback search or honest "not found"
- [ ] Agent does NOT hallucinate an answer when retrieval is insufficient

---

### TC-19.2: Pipe Commands in Shell

> **Pipes (|) are explicitly allowed in shell commands, but each command in the pipeline must be whitelisted. Tests valid and invalid pipe combinations.**

```
User: Show me all Python files sorted by size

Agent: [Should run something like `find . -name "*.py" | head -20`
        or `ls -lS *.py` — pipes are allowed between whitelisted commands]

User: How many lines of Python code are in this project?

Agent: [Should run `find . -name "*.py" | xargs wc -l` or similar pipe chain]

User: Can you pipe the output of ls to a file using ls > output.txt?

Agent: [Should refuse — output redirection (>) is blocked even though pipes (|) are allowed]
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Valid pipe chains between whitelisted commands execute successfully
- [ ] Each command in the pipeline is validated independently
- [ ] Redirection operators still blocked even in pipe context
- [ ] Agent distinguishes pipes from other shell operators

---

### TC-19.3: Duplicate Document Indexing

> **Tests what happens when the same document is indexed twice, or a modified version is re-indexed.**

```
User: Index the file README.md

Agent: [Should index successfully, report chunk count]

User: Index README.md again

Agent: [Should either skip (already indexed) or re-index and report.
        Should NOT create duplicate entries in the document list]

User: How many documents are indexed now?

Agent: [Should show README.md only once, not twice]

User: List all indexed documents

Agent: [Should confirm no duplicates]
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Re-indexing same file doesn't create duplicates
- [ ] Agent handles gracefully (skip or update)
- [ ] Document count remains accurate

---

### TC-19.4: System Status When Lemonade Is Down

> **Tests agent behavior when the LLM backend is unavailable or degraded.**

```

Agent: [Should report via /api/system/status — Lemonade running, model loaded, etc.]

User: Is the Lemonade server healthy?

Agent: [Should check and report current status]

User: What model is currently loaded?

Agent: [Should report the model ID from system status]
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] System status reports all components (Lemonade, model, embedding, disk, memory)
- [ ] Status values are accurate and current
- [ ] If Lemonade is unreachable, reports clearly (not crash or hang)

---

### TC-19.5: Partial Directory Indexing Failures

> **Tests graceful handling when some files in a directory fail to index.**

```
User: Index all files in the tests/ directory

Agent: [Should use index_directory — some files may fail (binary, too large, etc.)]

User: Were there any errors during indexing?

Agent: [Should report which files failed and why]

User: How many files were successfully indexed vs failed?

Agent: [Should give a clear success/failure breakdown]
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Successful files indexed despite other failures
- [ ] Failure reasons reported per file
- [ ] No silent failures — every file accounted for

---

### TC-19.6: File Search Boundary Conditions

> **Tests glob patterns, multi-word searches, and result limits.**

```
User: Find all files matching the pattern test_*.py

Agent: [Should use glob matching, not substring — test_foo.py matches, my_test.py doesn't]

User: Search for files named "agent chat"

Agent: [Should split into words and find files containing both "agent" AND "chat"]

User: Find all .md files in the docs folder

Agent: [If >20 results, should return first 20 and indicate there are more]
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Glob patterns matched correctly (not substring)
- [ ] Multi-word search requires all words present
- [ ] Result limit (20 files) enforced with clear indication of truncation

---

### TC-19.7: Watch Directory Behavior

```
User: Watch the tests/fixtures/agent_ui/ directory for new files

Agent: [Should add watch directory and index existing supported files]

User: What file types will be automatically indexed?

Agent: [Should list supported types: PDF, TXT, CSV, JSON, DOC, DOCX, etc.]

User: If I add a .mp4 file there, will it be indexed?

Agent: [Should explain that video files are not supported and will be skipped]
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Watch directory added successfully
- [ ] Only supported file types indexed
- [ ] Agent correctly explains which types are/aren't supported

---

### TC-19.8: Output Formatting Validation

> **Tests that agent responses render correctly with markdown formatting.**

```
User: Show me the project structure as a tree

Agent: [Should use code block formatting for the tree output]

User: Compare the sizes of the top 5 largest files as a table

Agent: [Should render a properly formatted markdown table with columns aligned]

User: Give me step-by-step instructions to set up the project

Agent: [Should use numbered list formatting with code blocks for commands]
```

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Code blocks used for terminal output and file trees
- [ ] Tables render with proper column headers and alignment
- [ ] Numbered lists used for sequential instructions
- [ ] Code snippets use appropriate syntax highlighting hints
