Pytest configuration file for GAIA test suite.

This file (conftest.py) is a special pytest file that provides:
- Shared fixtures available to ALL tests in the test suite
- Custom pytest command-line options
- Test session configuration

See: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/fixtures.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixtures-across-multiple-files

Current fixtures:
- _block_real_browser_launch: Session-autouse guard so no test can open a real browser
- api_server: Function-scoped fixture that starts GAIA API server for integration tests
- api_client: HTTP client (requests.Session) configured for API testing
- lemonade_available: Session-scoped fixture checking if Lemonade server is running
- require_lemonade: Fixture that skips tests if Lemonade is not available
- in_memory_keyring: Session-scoped fixture installing an in-memory keyring backend
  (used by tests/unit/connectors/ to avoid SecretService prerequisite on Linux CI)
- ui_api_client: Function-scoped TestClient against gaia.ui.server.create_app()
- mock_lemonade_client: Shared mock for LemonadeClient (requires pytest-mock)

Current options:
- --hybrid: Run tests with hybrid configuration (cloud + local models)

To add new fixtures for other test suites, define them in this file and they'll
be automatically available to all test files.
