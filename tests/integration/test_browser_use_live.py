"""Live-Chromium tests for the browser-use driver.

Everything here drives a real browser against a local HTML file — no network,
so the suite is deterministic and safe in CI. What it proves is exactly what a
mock cannot: that the injected snapshot script runs in a real page, that refs
resolve back to real elements, and that Playwright's thread-affinity does not
bite when each caller arrives on a different thread.

Skipped when the ``[browser]`` extra is not installed.
