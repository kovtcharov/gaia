"""No runtime string may tell a user to run the removed ``lemonade-server`` CLI.

Lemonade 10.7/10.8 removed ``lemonade-server serve`` and ``lemonade-server
pull``, so a hard-coded copy sends users to a command their machine does not
have (#4216). Start hints come from ``describe_start_hint()`` and pull hints
from ``describe_client_hint()``, which only name the legacy CLI when a legacy
install was actually resolved. The TUI resolves its own through the preflight
launcher.
