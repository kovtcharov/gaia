"""Packaging guard for the [mcp] extra's version pin (issue #2885).

setup.py's ``extras_require["mcp"]`` block carries a comment saying the mcp
dependency is "Capped below 2.0" because mcp 2.0.0 (released 2026-07-28)
removed ``mcp.server.fastmcp`` (``FastMCP`` was renamed to ``MCPServer`` and
moved to ``mcp.server.mcpserver``), breaking every FastMCP-based server GAIA
ships. But the pin itself reads ``mcp>=1.1.0,<3.0``, which does NOT enforce
the cap the comment describes: the comment and the enforced version range
contradict each other, so ``pip install`` can still resolve an mcp 2.x that
breaks those servers.

This file asserts two things, independently:

* the pin is exactly ``mcp>=1.1.0,<2.0`` (the enforced range, not the
  comment's claim about it);
* the comment directly above the pin and the pin itself never contradict
  each other — if the comment still says the dependency is "Capped below
  2.0", the enforced range must actually be ``<2.0``.

This is a static packaging assertion — it reads setup.py's source text and
never imports or installs anything, so it works in the CI unit-tests venv
that does not install [mcp]. Modelled on test_api_extras.py (#1617) and
test_base_keyring_dep.py (#1621).
