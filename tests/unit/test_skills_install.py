"""
End-to-end publish → install tests for the skills marketplace (#2467 B/C).

These are the acceptance criteria, exercised against a stand-in hub whose objects
are produced by the **real** publish path: ``publish_skill`` validates, runs the
audit gate, signs, and packages; the fake hub stores what it received and computes
the SHA-256 server-side; then ``install_skill`` resolves, downloads, checksums,
unpacks, and verifies signatures against those bytes. Nothing in the client is
stubbed out, so a checksum or signature regression fails here rather than in
production.

Cold state is the default: every root (skills, keys, trust store, lock, catalog
cache) lives under ``tmp_path``, and no test can see a skill, key, or trusted
publisher left behind by a previous run or by the developer's own machine.
