"""The agent-type registry pre-check must not reject sidecar-backed agents.

The email agent ships as an out-of-process sidecar: a binary-only Hub install
has no importable wheel, so ``registry.get("email")`` is ``None`` even when the
agent is installed and healthy. The chat guard must exempt sidecar types or the
email chat is unreachable on exactly the consumer machines the Hub install
targets — dev boxes mask this because they pip-install the wheel.

``chat`` is deliberately *not* exempt: it is created through the registry like
every other in-process agent, so the registry is what decides whether it is
reachable.
