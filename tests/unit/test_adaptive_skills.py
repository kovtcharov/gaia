"""Adaptive skills: the learned overlay (#2674).

Runs fully offline — no model, no network, no Lemonade. One command:

    pytest tests/unit/test_adaptive_skills.py -v

What it proves, in the order the sections appear below:

1. **Replace, not append.** The failure mode this feature exists to avoid is a
   learned "adjustment" pasted under the authored text, leaving the wrong
   instruction in the prompt beside the right one. Every replacement test
   asserts the old text is *gone*, not merely outranked.
2. **Learning does not inflate the prompt.** N corrections to one section cost
   what one costs, because a revised lesson supersedes its predecessor instead
   of stacking. Shape adaptation trends the resolved skill *smaller*.
3. **The authored file is never written.** Hashed before and after.
4. **A lesson applies at once, and only the user can teach one.** The agent
   activates what it learned in the same turn it learned it — and a turn in
   which anything else has spoken (a fetched page, a command's output) cannot
   teach it at all. The off-switch restores the authored bytes exactly.
5. **A base edit never silently re-points a delta** at text it was not approved
   against.
6. **The real bug from the session that motivated this** — a POSIX-quoted `gh`
   command that dies under Windows `cmd.exe` with "The system cannot find the
   path specified", which the agent misdiagnosed as a missing binary — is
   corrected end to end, and the corrected command actually runs.

The bring-your-own-CLI example. Run every GitHub command through
`run_shell_command`.

## Setup

```bash
gh auth login        # once, interactively
```

If `gh` is not installed the skill refuses to load and says so.

## Procedure

1. **Pull the backlog.** Ask for the repository if the user did not name one.

   ```bash
   {BROKEN_INBOX_CMD}
   ```

2. **Group before judging.** Cluster issues that describe the same underlying
   problem. Report the cluster, not each issue.

3. **Judge each cluster on severity and reach.** Rank by the pair.

## Rules

- Never close an issue on your own judgement.
- Report a refused command as a refusal.

## Fork this

Point it at your own repo's labels and severity ladder. The same shape works
for any CLI in GAIA's read-only command policy.

   ```

2. **Find what is blocking you.** PRs awaiting your review first.

3. **Rank by what unblocks other people**, then by severity and reach.

4. **Say what to do next** — one concrete action per item."""
