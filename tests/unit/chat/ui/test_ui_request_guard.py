"""Regression tests for the Agent UI cross-origin request guard.

Covers the two holes that let any web page the user visited drive the
backend:

* a mutating route shipping without the ``X-Gaia-UI`` CSRF check, and
* a CORS policy that trusted every ``*.ngrok-free.app`` /
  ``*.use.devtunnels.ms`` subdomain -- shared, self-service namespaces --
  with credentials and ``allow_headers=["*"]``, which handed an attacker
  an approved preflight for the very header the CSRF check relies on.

Everything here drives the ASGI stack directly rather than through
``TestClient``: ``tests/unit/conftest.py``'s network guard breaks
``socket.socketpair()`` on Windows, so a ``TestClient`` in this directory
errors during setup on that platform (review finding C41). Raw ASGI needs
no sockets and exercises the same middleware.
