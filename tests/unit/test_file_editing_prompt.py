"""The edit tools have to be mentioned in the prompt, or the agent shells out.

Measured on 30 corpus moments whose correct next action was an edit, with the
target file already held: the shipped prompt named the shell seven times with
worked recipes and ``edit_file`` not once. The agent shelled out or re-read
instead of editing on 23 of them. Adding the fragment took working edits from
1 to 6 and shell fallbacks from 19 to 12.

These tests pin the fragment's existence and its discovery, not its wording —
the wording should stay tunable.
