"""Tool-prompt cost baseline for the dynamic tool-loader (#1448, parent #688).

Part 0 is measure-only. This pins the *current* (unfiltered) tool-prompt
cost so Part 1 (#1449) can prove a reduction, and asserts the load-bearing
shape of the measurements:

* the deterministic doc tool set is a fixed size,
* the native (JSON-schema) path is much heavier than the text path — that
  is where the loader's savings come from,
* prompt cost grows ~linearly per added tool, and
* a fixed *loaded* subset stays flat as the *registry* grows (cost tracks
  tools loaded, not registered).

The cost/slope/distribution checks are model-free (no Lemonade backend).
The TTFT parser is exercised against a committed scorecard fixture, so the
Component-C parsing logic is covered without a live eval run.

The pinned numbers below are tiktoken `cl100k_base` / char measurements of
the unfiltered doc registry. They are a deliberate baseline: if you
legitimately add or remove a doc-profile tool, update these in the same
commit (and note it in the PR) — the same discipline as the #1030
system-prompt budget test.

Only ``test_harness_runs_and_pins_baseline`` and its token twin compare
against those pins, so a registry-wide schema change fails there and nowhere
else. The Part-1 reduction guards below express shares of a baseline measured
in the same run, which is what makes them detect a real regression in the
filtered set rather than growth anywhere in the registry.

# These bound the *native-schema* token cost of a filtered loaded set as a share
# of the unfiltered registry. They are a proxy only — the authoritative gate is
# the live ``measure_prefill_ttft`` run in Step 6; token count tracks prefill
# cost but is not identical to it.
#
# Both guards measure their baseline in the same run rather than reading the
# pinned constants above. A share is the quantity these tests are actually
# about, and it is the only form that stays meaningful as the registry grows:
# a pinned denominator turns every schema-wide edit into a spurious failure
# here, on top of the one real failure in the pin test.
#
# Measured reality (worth knowing — it tempers the original estimate): the
# always-on CORE tools alone render ~40% of the native baseline, because the
# memory tools carry the longest docstrings. So CORE-only is the best case
# (~60% token reduction, right at the gate boundary), and a worst-case
# ``max_tools=14`` loaded set lands around ~60% of baseline. The first-turn win
# is real and large; whether it clears ≥60% in *TTFT* terms is what the live run
# decides.

# CORE is the always-on floor; its share of the registry sits near 40% on both
# paths. The ceilings leave room for wording edits and bite on real bloat.
