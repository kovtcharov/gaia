"""Unit spec for broker-wiring the direct model-load surfaces (#2248).

V2-11 (#2151) put a lease around ``_ensure_model_loaded`` only, so the surfaces
that call ``load_model`` directly — the UI backend's startup preload and
per-request pre-flight, the RAG embedder warm-up, CLI runs — still raced the
single Lemonade model slot. This spec pins the three things that fix:

1. **The chokepoint.** ``LemonadeClient.load_model`` itself takes the lease, so
   every direct caller is covered without having to remember to wrap itself.
2. **Re-entrancy.** Callers that wrap a multi-step ``unload``→``load`` sequence
   in an outer lease must not self-deadlock on the inner one — the broker grants
   exactly one lease at a time.
3. **Host-side discovery.** Only daemon-*spawned* processes inherit the broker
   URL, so host-side processes must attach to a live daemon themselves or the
   lease code never activates.

Serialization is proven against a REAL :class:`ModelSlotBroker` (its true
queueing/priority logic) with only the HTTP hop faked — a mock that merely
records "a lease was requested" would prove invocation, not mutual exclusion
(CLAUDE.md: assert the call is valid, not just that it happened).

      no undo for a variable that was absent when it was asked to delete it — so
      the address one test attaches to would leak into every later test in the

    Every other test here fakes the HTTP hop, which proves the client *asks* for
    a lease but never that the daemon would *accept* the request — the exact gap
    CLAUDE.md calls out (#1655). This stands up the real ``/host/v1`` route on an
    ephemeral port and checks both halves of the contract: the discovered daemon
    client token authenticates as the ``"host"`` caller, and four concurrent
    loads genuinely serialize end to end.
