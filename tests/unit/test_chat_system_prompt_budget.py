"""Regression budget for ``ChatAgent._get_system_prompt`` (#1030).

The Gemma-4-E4B default LLM was timing out on the very first PLANNING
call when running ``gaia chat --index <pdf> --query "..."`` because the
ChatAgent system prompt had grown to ~15 000 tokens of inlined rules and
multi-paragraph examples — large enough that prompt processing on
Windows iGPU exceeded Lemonade's internal upstream curl timeout.

This test pins a hard size budget so future additions to the prompt are
forced to budget-balance (compact something else, or move new rules
behind a conditional) instead of silently re-bloating it.

If you intentionally need more headroom for a new feature, raise the
budget here in the same commit that adds the prompt content — and only
after verifying with a live ``gaia chat --index ... --query ...`` run on
Gemma that the cold-start latency is still sane.
