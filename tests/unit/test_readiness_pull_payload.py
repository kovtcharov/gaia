"""``pull_model`` must send the payload Lemonade actually accepts.

Lemonade wants OPPOSITE payloads for its two kinds of model, and the wrong one
fails only on a COLD cache — so a warm machine, and every mock that returns 200
without looking, reports success either way. These tests assert the *shape of
the outgoing request*, which is the part that differs.

The live failure: ``user.embeddinggemma-300m-GGUF`` pulled with name only
returns HTTP 500 ``not registered with Lemonade Server``, which made the TUI's
"press f to fix" unable to fix anything.
