"""
The backend-test step in publish.yml is the release's only pytest gate — assert
it can actually fail.

``test_unit.yml`` triggers on pushes to ``main``, not on the ``v*`` tag that
starts a release, so this one step in ``build-npm`` is the whole Python test
coverage between a tag and PyPI/npm. It shipped with ``2>/dev/null || echo
"Backend tests skipped"``, which made it green whether the tests passed, failed,
or never ran (issue #3508).

These are configuration assertions, not behaviour tests. They exist because the
failure mode is silent: the step still runs and still goes green, it just stops
gating anything.
