"""run_shell_command must not lose output it cannot decode in the OS locale.

The bug these guard: the executor used bare ``text=True``, which decodes with
the locale codec — cp1252 on a default Windows box. subprocess performs that
decode inside its pipe reader THREAD, so an undecodable byte raises
UnicodeDecodeError there, the thread dies, and ``subprocess.run`` returns
returncode 0 with EMPTY stdout. The command succeeded and its output was
silently discarded, with nothing in the result to say so.

It was not hypothetical: ``gh issue list --repo amd/gaia`` returns a title
containing "⚠️", so GitHub triage received an empty backlog and the model
reported on issues it had never read. Any tool emitting UTF-8 (git, gh, npm,
docker) reaches this path.
