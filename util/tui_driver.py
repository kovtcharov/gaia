"""Single-process driver for the GAIA TUI control API.

Point ``CJ`` at the ``control.json`` inside your ``GAIA_TUI_HOME``, then:

    python util/tui_driver.py status
    python util/tui_driver.py ask "What is 17 times 23?"
    python util/tui_driver.py ladder          # the full capability ladder
    python util/tui_driver.py gate            # gh command-policy tiers (no LLM, instant)

Why one process: spawning a process costs 0.7-2.0s on a Windows/MSYS box with AV
(``curl --version`` alone measures ~2s), while the control API answers in 3ms. A
shell driver that spawns curl+python per step spends all its time in process
creation. Everything here runs in one process over one kept-alive connection.

Always run with PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 or captures die on the spinner glyphs.
