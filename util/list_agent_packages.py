"""List the AMD production agent packages that ship as ``gaia-agent-<id>`` wheels.

Single source of truth = the ``AGENT_WHEEL_PACKAGES`` list in ``setup.py``.
This script reads that list *statically* (``ast``, never executing
``setup.py``), maps each ``gaia-agent-<id>`` distribution name to its package
directory under ``hub/agents/<id>/python/``, and verifies the directory
exists.

``AGENT_WHEEL_PACKAGES`` deliberately lives as a plain module-level constant,
not an ``extras_require`` entry (issue #2240): while the ``gaia-agent-*``
wheels aren't published to PyPI, declaring them as an extra made
``pip install "amd-gaia[agents]"`` unsatisfiable at the current release,
which made pip/uv silently backtrack-downgrade to an older amd-gaia that
didn't declare the extra. Keeping the list out of the package's own metadata
avoids handing pip's resolver something it can't satisfy, while keeping a
single place both this tool and end users (``gaia.agents.install_hints``)
read from.

Consumers:

* ``.github/workflows/publish_agents.yml`` calls ``--format matrix`` to generate
  the build/publish matrix, so adding an agent to ``setup.py``'s
  ``AGENT_WHEEL_PACKAGES`` is all it takes to start publishing its wheel — no
  second list to keep in sync.
* ``tests/unit/test_agent_pypi_publish.py`` calls :func:`list_agent_packages`
  to assert the published set, the on-disk packages, and their ``amd-gaia``
  dependency all agree.

Per ``CLAUDE.md`` (No Silent Fallbacks): a distribution listed with no
matching ``hub/agents/<id>/python/`` directory, or a malformed ``setup.py``,
raises rather than silently dropping the agent from the publish set.
