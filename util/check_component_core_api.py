Check that each hub component's ``min_gaia_version`` names a core release that
can actually serve the daemon host API that component requires.

Why this exists
---------------
The terminal hub (``tui/``) refuses to attach to a daemon whose host API MAJOR
differs, or whose MINOR is below the one that added the ``/daemon/v1/agents``
control plane and the ``/v1/<agent>/*`` relay. Those two numbers live in
``tui/internal/daemon/instance.go`` as ``RequiredAPIMajor`` /
``RequiredAgentsMinor`` and are enforced by ``Instance.CheckAgentsFloor()``.

``hub/components/terminal-hub/gaia-agent.yaml`` separately hardcodes
``min_gaia_version``. Nothing tied the two together, so the manifest could — and
did — promise compatibility with a core release that predates the control plane.
A user installing the declared minimum would get a binary that fails preflight
on every check.

Comparing the manifest against ``src/gaia/daemon/constants.py`` in THIS tree
would not have caught it: the tree already has the new API. The break is between
the tree and a *published* artifact, so the check has to reason about what each
core release actually shipped.

Two modes, deliberately
-----------------------
Offline (the default) answers from the pinned ``RELEASED_DAEMON_API`` table
below, so unit tests and PR CI stay deterministic and network-free.

``--verify-released`` audits that table against PyPI — every pinned row is
re-read out of the published wheel, and ``LATEST_CORE_RELEASE`` is checked
against the versions PyPI actually serves. That audit runs over the table
itself, NOT only over whatever version a manifest happens to name: a component
pinned to an unreleased version has nothing to fetch, so a manifest-driven check
would quietly do no work in exactly the release where the table went stale.

Usage:
    python util/check_component_core_api.py
    python util/check_component_core_api.py --verify-released
    python util/check_component_core_api.py --release-version 0.23.0

Exit codes:
    0 - every component's declared minimum core can serve it
    1 - a component declares a minimum core that cannot serve it
