# Driving the live TUI

The TUI exposes a loopback control API so an assistant can operate it and read
what a user would see. **Use it. Never sleep.**

## Isolate memory before you start it — every time

**Set `GAIA_MEMORY_DB` to a throwaway file in every drive.** The agent behind the
TUI writes to the user's real `~/.gaia/memory.db` by default, and anything you say
while driving becomes a permanent fact about the user:

```bash
export GAIA_MEMORY_DB=/tmp/gaia-drive/memory.db     # delete between runs
```

A drive once planted a persona's overdue deadline; days later the user said
"sweet!" and got *"Priya needs that Fernbrook deck ASAP."* back. The false bug
reports this skill exists to prevent have a mirror image — a real report caused
by a test.

`gaia eval agent` already resets memory between scenarios; a hand-driven session
has no such cleanup, so isolation has to come from the environment. A blank value,
or one naming a directory, is a startup error rather than a fall back to the real
store — if the agent refuses to start, fix the path, don't unset the variable.
`GAIA_HOME` moves the whole `~/.gaia` tree if you want one switch for everything.

## Start it

```bash
/path/to/gaia --control-port 8815     # --control also works (auto-assigns)
```

Off by default: `--control` is `false`, binds `127.0.0.1` only (`control.Host`),
and is bearer-token authenticated (token in `~/.gaia/tui/control.json`, mode
0600, compared with `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`). Verified unreachable from the
host's LAN address. Launch it in **its own Terminal window** — a long-lived
process started from a background tool call gets SIGKILLed (exit 137).

## Endpoints

`/control/v1/` — `status` · `screen` · `keys` · `text` · **`wait`** · `frames` · `resize`

## The rule: wait, don't sleep

`POST /control/v1/wait` blocks **server-side** until a condition holds:
`{"contains": "..."}`, `{"absent": "..."}`, or `{"state": {...}}` (ANDed), with
`timeout_ms`. A turn takes 12-90s depending on the model and tools; a fixed
`sleep` is either a wasted minute or a half-rendered capture. Waiting on
`absent: "streaming"` returns the instant the turn ends.

`/tmp/drive.sh` (recreate if missing — /tmp is cleared) should expose:
`keys` · `text` · `resize` · `wait <s>` · `gone <s>` · `ask <text>` · `screen [lo hi]`,
where `ask` types, submits, and blocks on `gone streaming`.

## Capture mistakes that cause false bug reports

- **Always `screen 0 999`.** A cropped capture once produced a fabricated
  "uninstall silently does nothing" — the status line is the second-to-last row.
- **`resize` FIRST** or cols/rows are 0 and everything wraps wrongly.
- **`format=plain` strips ANSI.** You cannot judge colour or styling from a
  capture. Read the renderer's source for `lipgloss` calls instead.
- **Check the screen you are actually on** before sending keys. Keys sent to the
  wrong screen do nothing and read as "the binding is broken".
- `screencapture` is blocked on this machine. Use the control API text.

## Know which build you are driving

Stacked branches are siblings; no single branch contains everything. A leaf
build shows behaviour already fixed elsewhere — this produced a bug report for
something fixed on another branch. Build from a merged integration branch, or
say explicitly which slice you tested.

Similarly, `mode: user` runs the **published frozen sidecar**, which is routinely
older than source (2.4 vs 2.6). Confirm with
`gaia daemon start-agent <id> --mode dev` when testing source behaviour, and
check `api_version` in `GET /daemon/v1/agents`.

## The card/context trap

Cards are rendered by the TUI from `tool_result.render`, not by the sidecar. The
transcript pushed back as `context` must therefore carry a compact record of what
was displayed, or a follow-up referring to a visible row ("when is that one?")
resolves against nothing. See `SSEClient.appendTurn` / `displayedCard`.

## Reporting what you saw

Write results per [CLAUDE.md → How You
Communicate](../../../CLAUDE.md#how-you-communicate): open with whether the thing works, in
one plain sentence, then the captures and `file:line` detail beneath it. Say plainly which
screens you never reached — an unstated gap reads as a pass.
