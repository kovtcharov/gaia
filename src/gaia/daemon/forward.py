"""OAuth forward-OUT — the daemon (custody home) forwards short-lived connector
access tokens to a sidecar (issue #2154 / V2-14).

Role inversion (design §0.6): the daemon owns the long-lived OAuth refresh token
and the per-agent grant ledger; N sidecars each holding a refresh token would
rotate each other out, so the daemon stays the single writer and forwards only
SHORT-LIVED access tokens OUT to the sidecar's ``/v1/connections/{provider}``
intake. The sidecar never receives the refresh token or the OAuth client secret.

What this module does NOT do (kept in the layers that already own them, no
duplication):

- **Refresh** — reuses the client-neutral engine via
  ``gaia.connectors.api.get_access_token_with_expiry_sync`` (grant + scope gated,
  then ``tokens.get_token_with_expiry``). There is no second refresh path here.
- **Grant policy** — the connectors grant ledger is the source of truth. A
  provider not granted to the agent's ``grant_agent_id`` is never forwarded.
- **Custody stores** — this is credential forwarding only; memory/RAG/sessions
  custody is #2153's ``/host/v1``.

Fail loudly, no silent fallbacks (CLAUDE.md):

- provider not granted to the agent → :class:`NotGrantedError` (the daemon route
  maps it to 403; the sidecar never gets a token it wasn't authorized for);
- mint fails because the connection was revoked / not connected → the underlying
  ``AuthRequiredError`` is re-raised AND any stale forward is withdrawn from the
  sidecar, so the sidecar loses access loudly rather than running on a stale
  token; transport failures are logged and leave a still-valid forward alone
  for the next refresh tick;
- the sidecar intake POST/DELETE fails → :class:`ForwardDeliveryError` naming
  the sidecar URL and the transport error.

``forward_all`` (the on-spawn push) is best-effort *per provider* — one
provider's failure is logged with context and does not abort forwarding the
others — but nothing is swallowed: every failure is surfaced in the returned
summary and in the log, and the sidecar's own resolver raises loudly at
mailbox-use time if a token never arrived.
