"""Streaming reverse-proxy for agent routes — the daemon's data plane
(``ANY /v1/<agent>/*``, issue #2150 / V2-7).

Clients present only the DAEMON client token; the daemon swaps it for the
per-agent sidecar bearer server-side (via ``SidecarRegistry.connection``), so
sidecar credentials never leave the daemon for relayed traffic. The
``/daemon/v1/*`` control plane is untouched — this router is the second,
data-plane mount over the same registry.

Behavior by upstream response type:

- ``text/event-stream`` — relayed UNBUFFERED (``httpx.AsyncClient(stream=True)``
  chunks → ``StreamingResponse``): each upstream chunk is forwarded the moment
  it arrives. A passive :class:`_SSEWatcher` observes the bytes (never altering
  them) to learn the ``run_id`` and whether the frozen 7-event contract's
  single terminal ``final``/``error`` event has passed.
- anything else — buffered passthrough with status, headers, and body
  preserved (fixed-function routes; per V2-7 the buffered path is fine there).

Crash semantics (§0.13): if the stream ends — EOF or transport error — WITHOUT
a terminal event, the relay appends one synthetic terminal error frame::

    data: {"type": "error", "detail": "<actionable message>", "source": "daemon_relay"}

and ends the response cleanly. The shape is the canonical contract's own
``error`` event plus an additive ``source`` marker so downstream front-doors
(V2-8 CLI, V2-17 ``gaia api``) can tell a relay-synthesized terminal from a
sidecar-authored one.

Cancel semantics: a client disconnect (or a non-terminal stream end) triggers a
best-effort ``POST /v1/<agent>/query/<run_id>/cancel`` upstream — mirroring
``gaia.ui.email_sidecar.relay``'s crash/cancel handling — so an abandoned run
stops occupying the single-tenant LLM slot. Best-effort by design: the sidecar
may already be dead, so transport failures are logged, never raised.

Loud errors, no silent fallbacks: unknown agent → 404 naming the registered
ids; registered-but-not-running, or alive but no longer answering its own
``/health`` → 503 naming the remedy; upstream unreachable mid-flight → 502
carrying the transport error.
