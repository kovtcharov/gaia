"""The daemon's versioned client API surface (``/daemon/v1/*``).

Skeleton scope: a token-guarded ``status`` route and a ``shutdown`` route. Later
issues mount the custody API (``/host/v1/*``), the model broker, and the scheduler
into this same app.

Every ``/daemon/v1`` route requires the client token minted at startup. A request
without a valid token gets a 401 whose detail names what failed, what to do, and
where to look — no silent fallback to an unauthenticated response.

    *token*, *port*, *pid*, *started_at* are captured in the closure so the status
    payload and the auth check need no shared global state. *on_startup* /
    *on_shutdown* run inside the app lifespan — the daemon registers instance.json
    on startup (once the port is bound) and deregisters on shutdown. *registry*
    (a :class:`gaia.daemon.sidecars.registry.SidecarRegistry`) mounts the
    ``/daemon/v1/agents`` control plane and the ``/v1/<agent>/*`` streaming
    relay (#2150); ``None`` leaves both unmounted. *forwarder* (a
    :class:`gaia.daemon.forward.ConnectionForwarder`) additionally mounts the
    ``/daemon/v1/agents/{id}/connections`` OAuth forward-out plane (#2154); it
    requires *registry* (it resolves the target sidecar from it). *broker* (a
    :class:`gaia.daemon.broker.ModelSlotBroker`) mounts the ``/host/v1/models/*``
    lease route (#2151 / V2-11); ``None`` leaves it unmounted.

    *custody_auth* + *custody_store* mount the ``/host/v1/*`` custody reverse
    contract (#2153): the secret→agent-id resolver and the SQLite backing. Both
    must be provided together; either ``None`` leaves the custody API unmounted
    (so a skeleton/test daemon can run without it). The custody API is guarded by
    its OWN per-spawn secrets (bound at mint), NOT the client ``token`` — it is a
    separate surface with its own MAJOR (§0.31), so it is not behind
    ``require_token``.

    *lemonade* (a :class:`gaia.llm.lemonade_supervisor.LemonadeSupervisor`) mounts
    ``/daemon/v1/lemonade/*``, through which a front-end asks the daemon to start
    the local model server. The daemon owns that process — no front-end spawns
    one — so this router is the only way in. ``None`` leaves it unmounted.

    *clock* (a :class:`gaia.daemon.scheduler.clock.DaemonClock`) additively
    reports its running state, last poll time, and pending/failed job counts
    on ``GET /daemon/v1/status`` (#2379); ``None`` (the default) leaves the
    response exactly as it was before the clock existed.

    *lemonade_owner* (a :class:`gaia.daemon.lemonade.EmbeddedLemonadeOwner`)
    mounts ``POST /daemon/v1/lemonade/ensure``, which starts GAIA's embedded
    Lemonade Server if it is stopped and returns where it listens.
