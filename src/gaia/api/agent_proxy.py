"""Thin data-plane proxy exposing ``/v1/<agent>/query`` on ``gaia api`` (#2178 /
V2-17).

The API server is a thin client of the always-on GAIA daemon: it forwards
``ANY /v1/<agent>/*`` to the daemon's streaming relay (#2150 / V2-7) carrying
only the DAEMON client token. The daemon swaps that for the per-agent sidecar
bearer server-side, so the API server never learns sidecar coordinates nor holds
a sidecar bearer — the whole point of the thin-host model.

SSE bodies stream UNBUFFERED (``httpx.AsyncClient(stream=True)`` chunks →
``StreamingResponse``): each daemon chunk is forwarded the moment it arrives.
The daemon owns the crash/cancel synthetic-terminal contract (§0.13) — this proxy
forwards those frames verbatim and only authors its OWN synthetic terminal
``error`` when the DAEMON connection itself drops mid-stream (a failure the
daemon relay cannot report, being the thing that died). A client disconnect
closes the upstream connection, which the daemon relay sees as ITS client
disconnect and propagates as an upstream cancel to the sidecar.

Auth: the ``/v1/<agent>/*`` surface exposes the agentic loop, and ``gaia api``
may bind beyond loopback, so it is gated by an API key (``GAIA_API_KEY``) —
stricter than the daemon's loopback trust (§0.33). ``/v1/chat/completions`` and
``/v1/models`` are untouched. No silent fallback: an unset key, a missing/invalid
key, an unreachable daemon, and a dead sidecar each raise a loud, actionable HTTP
error (the daemon's own 404/503/502 envelope is preserved for the last two).
