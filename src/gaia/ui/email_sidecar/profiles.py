"""Per-agent knobs for the shared sidecar ``/query`` relay (#4161).

Everything about relaying a sidecar run is identical between agents except a
handful of values: the contract floor to refuse below, the copy the user sees,
which tool names deserve a friendly label, and which tools change durable state
and so warrant a visible status line. Those live here, one :class:`RelayProfile`
per agent, so :mod:`gaia.ui.email_sidecar.relay` stays agent-agnostic and adding
the next sidecar is a profile, not another branch.

Deliberately NOT in ``gaia.daemon.sidecars.spec``: that spec describes what the
daemon must do to *supervise* a sidecar (binaries, tokens, modes, connector
scopes). This is presentation — what the Agent UI shows while relaying one.

    #: agent isn't ready yet"). Lower-case except for proper nouns.
    display_name: str
    #: Terminal error when the stream closes without a ``final``/``error``.
    #: Per-agent so it names the log the reader should actually open.
    stream_ended_message: str
    #: Contract floor, as ``(major, minor)``. A sidecar below this 404s or
    #: mis-speaks the relay's request shape, so it is refused BEFORE the first
    #: POST with :attr:`version_upgrade_message` rather than failing obscurely
    #: mid-stream. The daemon's own handshake only pins MAJOR.
    min_api_version: Tuple[int, int]
    #: Shown when :attr:`min_api_version` is not met — at pre-flight and again
    #: as the 404 backstop in the relay, so both read identically.
    version_upgrade_message: str
    #: ``tool_call`` name -> friendly label. The relay has no in-process tool
    #: registry for a sidecar's tools, so each agent owns its own map; anything
    #: unlisted is humanized from the tool name.
    tool_labels: Mapping[str, str] = field(default_factory=lambda: MappingProxyType({}))
    #: Tools that change durable state without passing a confirmation gate.
    #: The relay emits a visible status line for these rather than burying
    #: them in the collapsed activity panel.
    mutating_tools: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset()
    #: What that status line calls the change ("✎ <change_noun>: <tool>"), so
    #: it names what was actually touched instead of a generic "change".
    change_noun: str = "change"
    #: Appended — never substituted — to a connection-shaped terminal error,

    #: importable in-process registration exists. True for email, whose
    #: in-process tool-calling loop was retired in favour of the relay
    #: (#2109). False for the flagship: a wheel/dev install registers a real
    #: factory and runs in-process (that is what ``gaia eval agent`` drives),
    #: while a Hub binary install registers only the raise-on-call stand-in
    #: and must relay. Which one you have is an install-kind question, not an
    #: agent-id question.
    always_relay: bool = False
    #: Whether a not-ready ``/init`` (503) STOPS the turn.
    #:
    #: True for email: its ``/init`` is half of a provisioning handshake the
    #: user completes from the agent card, and running a triage against an
    #: unprovisioned mailbox wastes a long model call to reach the same
    #: answer.
    #:
    #: False for the flagship, whose ``/init`` is only a read-only probe —
    #: and an imperfect one. Observed: against a Lemonade that requires
    #: auth, its probe reports unreachable while ``/query`` answers normally.
    #: Halting on that turns a working agent into a dead one, so the hint is
    #: shown and the turn proceeds; if the backend really is down, the query's
    #: own error says so with the remedy already appended.
    #:
    #: Narrow by design: only the UNREACHABLE cause is treated this way (see
    #: ``_chat_helpers._probe_is_only_unreachable``). A 503 that says the
    #: model is missing, or that Lemonade is below the required version, is
    #: the server answering accurately and still blocks.
    readiness_is_blocking: bool = True
    #: Whether to send ``session_id`` on the ``/query`` body. Gated per agent
    #: because the request model is ``extra="forbid"`` on both sidecars: an
