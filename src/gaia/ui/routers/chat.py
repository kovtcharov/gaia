"""Chat endpoint for GAIA Agent UI.

Provides the ``/api/chat/send`` endpoint with both streaming (SSE) and
non-streaming response modes.  The heavy chat logic (``_get_chat_response``,
``_stream_chat_response``) lives in ``gaia.ui._chat_helpers`` and is
accessed through ``gaia.ui.server`` so that test patches applied to
``gaia.ui.server._get_chat_response`` etc. take effect.
