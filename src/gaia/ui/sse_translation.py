Translate the in-process agent-loop SSE vocabulary into the frozen ``/query``
canonical wire contract (#2015 spec, first implemented for email in #2016).

The loop→SSE seam already exists: ``gaia.ui.sse_handler.SSEOutputHandler`` turns
every agent-loop ``console.print_*`` call into a typed JSON event on a queue. But
that handler emits its **own** vocabulary (``status`` / ``step`` / ``thinking`` /
``plan`` / ``tool_start`` / ``tool_args`` / ``tool_result`` / ``tool_end`` /
``chunk`` / ``answer`` / ``permission_request`` / ``user_input_request`` /
``tool_confirm_denied`` / ``agent_error`` / ``policy_alert`` / ``agent_created``),
which is **not** the v2 contract.

This module is the reusable translation layer (spec §6): a **total,
source-exhaustive** mapping from the handler's vocabulary onto the canonical
event types —

    status | token | tool_call | tool_result | needs_confirmation
          | needs_input | final | error

— terminated by exactly one ``final`` or ``error``. It is dependency-light (this
module plus the stdlib-only :mod:`gaia.ui.event_narration`) so it unit-tests
without Lemonade, a mailbox, or a live agent, and so the OpenAPI export stays
cheap.

Per-agent shape is injected, not hardcoded: ``agent_id`` (drives ``respond_url``),
``render_tool_map`` (which tool draws which card), ``action_labels`` +
``summary_renderer`` (how a gated action is described to the human). Defaults are
generic, so an agent that needs none of it constructs with just ``agent_id``.

Design commitments
------------------
- **No source event left unmapped** (spec §6.2). Every top-level type the handler
  emits has an explicit map / fold / drop decision below.
- **Buffer ``tool_start`` + ``tool_args`` into one ``tool_call``** (spec §6.3): the
  handler emits the name first and the arguments separately; the canonical
  ``tool_call`` carries ``{tool, args}`` together.
- **Describe the work, not the harness** (#2804). ``tool_call`` carries an
  additive ``narration`` ("Running command: git status") and ``tool_result`` an
  additive one-line ``preview`` ("18 skills · 21ms"), both from
  :mod:`gaia.ui.event_narration`. Conversely the loop's own bookkeeping —
  ``Step 3/50``, ``Processing with <model>...``, a bare ``Thinking`` — is
  tagged ``channel="debug"`` at the source and dropped here unless the
  translator is constructed with ``debug=True`` (or ``GAIA_SSE_DEBUG_EVENTS``
  is set). Those lines stay available for harness development; they just stop
  being the only thing a user sees during a two-minute turn.
- **Fail loudly, never silently.** A fatal top-level ``agent_error`` and a
  governance ``policy_alert`` map to a terminal ``error`` with an actionable
  ``detail`` — never a placeholder. A **recoverable** ``agent_error`` (the
  source event's ``recoverable`` flag, set by ``agent.py``'s
  ``STATE_ERROR_RECOVERY`` retry path) is explicitly NOT terminal — it folds
  to a ``status`` line so the run continues (#2515). The ``None`` queue
  sentinel is *stream close*, handled by the drain loop, not a wire event.

Spec open questions surfaced in this file:
- **Q2** — ``policy_alert`` maps to ``error`` (status 403). A governance block is
  per-*tool* (the run may continue) whereas canonical ``error`` is terminal; a
  dedicated additive event type may be warranted. See spec §9 Q2.
- **Q3 — RESOLVED (#2469).** ``user_input_request`` maps to the eighth canonical
  type ``needs_input`` (answerable, run continues), NOT to
  ``needs_confirmation`` (terminal approve/deny). See spec §5.1.
- **Q4 (D1)** — ``needs_confirmation`` omits ``confirm_url`` under the stateless
  stop-and-hand-off model (no server-side resume). See spec §5 / §9 Q4.
