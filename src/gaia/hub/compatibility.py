"""System-requirements checker for the Agent Hub install flow.

Given an agent's declared ``requirements`` (the block from ``gaia-agent.yaml``
/ the catalog index entry), this module reports whether the current machine can
run it.  The result separates *blockers* (hard reasons the install must be
refused — wrong platform, not enough disk for the download) from *warnings*
(soft, recommended-but-not-required gaps — below the suggested RAM, no NPU
detected).  ``compatible`` is true exactly when there are no blockers.

The checker is the single place the install lifecycle (``installer.install``)
and the catalog endpoint (``GET /api/agents/catalog``) consult, so the UI and
the backend agree on what "compatible" means.

Detection is best-effort but never silent: anything we cannot probe (GPU/NPU
presence) becomes a *warning* that names what we could not verify — it never
silently passes as if the requirement were met.
