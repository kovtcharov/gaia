"""Thread-confined Playwright driver with a persistent browser.

Two facts about the host decide this design.

**Every tool body runs in a fresh daemon thread.** ``Agent._call_tool_bounded``
spawns one per call, and Playwright's sync objects are thread-affine — created
on one thread, unusable from another. So Playwright lives on a single
long-lived worker thread of its own and every operation is marshalled to it.

**The browser stays open between calls.** A cold Chromium launch is 1–3 s; the
CDP command it carries is 1–10 ms. Launching per tool call would make the
driver, rather than the model, the thing the user waits for. The browser is
launched lazily on first use and reused for the rest of the session.
