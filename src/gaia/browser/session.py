"""Encrypted browser session storage.

A logged-in session is cookies plus ``localStorage`` — tens of KB. That does
not fit in the OS credential store: Windows Credential Manager caps an entry
around 1280 characters, and ``connectors/mcp_server.py`` writes secrets with a
bare ``keyring.set_password`` (the chunking helpers in ``connectors/store.py``
are private to that module). Putting a cookie jar down that path fails on
Windows.

So the split is **key in the keyring, ciphertext on disk**:

    keyring:  gaia.connections / browser-session-key   (32-byte AES key)
    disk:     ~/.gaia/browser/sessions/<sha256(origin)>.enc   0600, AES-GCM
              ~/.gaia/browser/sessions/<sha256(origin)>.json  0600, metadata

The metadata file holds no secrets, so what is stored can be listed without
decrypting anything (:func:`listing`).
