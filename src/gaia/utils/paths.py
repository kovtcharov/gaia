"""One safe way to turn an untrusted string into a single path segment.

Anywhere GAIA joins a name it did not choose — a hub manifest's
``artifact.filename``, an archive member, a caller-supplied basename — onto a
directory it did choose, ``Path(dir) / name`` is a write primitive, not a join.
``pathlib`` collapses ``.`` back to the directory, leaves ``..`` at its parent,
and lets an absolute name (or a bare Windows drive prefix such as ``C:evil.zip``)
replace the directory outright.

:func:`safe_path_segment` is the one check those call sites should share. It is
deliberately stricter than "no slashes": it also refuses drive-relative and UNC
shapes, NT device names, control characters, and the trailing dots/spaces
Windows silently strips — all of which survive a naive separator scan.
