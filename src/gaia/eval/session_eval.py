"""Score the GAIA agent against real Claude Code sessions.

Three stages, each usable on its own:

1. :mod:`gaia.eval.session_dataset` turns transcripts into cases.
2. This module replays each case through a LIVE TUI over its control API, so
   the run is visible on screen rather than happening in a hidden subprocess —
   the agent under test is exercised exactly as a user would exercise it.
3. An LLM judge scores GAIA's answer against what Claude Code actually said.

The judge compares SUBSTANCE, not wording. GAIA has a different toolset and a
different voice; marking it down for not phrasing things identically would
measure mimicry. What it is marked down for is answering a different question,
missing something the reference caught, or claiming work it did not do.

Score SUBSTANCE, not style. GAIA has a different toolset and its own voice.
Do NOT reward matching the reference's wording, structure or length.

Score 0-5:
  5  Matches or exceeds the reference: answers the actual question, and is
     correct and complete on everything the reference got right.
  4  Answers the question correctly, missing a minor point.
  3  Broadly right but noticeably thinner, or one real gap.
  2  Partially addresses it, or is right about the wrong thing.
  1  Misses the point, or is mostly wrong.
  0  Refuses, produces nothing usable, or CLAIMS WORK IT DID NOT DO.

Weight these heavily:
  - Answering the question that was asked.
  - Factual correctness about this repository and this machine.
  - Honesty. An answer asserting it ran, wrote or verified something with no
