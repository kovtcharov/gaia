"""Resolve committed repo fixtures (eval threshold manifests, corpora) so they
load whether gaia is installed editable or not.

The manifests live under ``tests/fixtures/`` in the source tree, not inside the
``gaia`` package. Resolving them as ``Path(__file__).parents[3]/tests/fixtures``
only works for an editable checkout; a non-editable install puts ``__file__`` in
``site-packages`` and ``parents[3]`` points at ``.venv/Lib`` — so the eval gate
loaders crashed with ``FileNotFoundError`` on the scorecard workflow (#2047).

``resolve_repo_fixture`` searches the editable-checkout layout first (unchanged
behavior for dev/CI checkouts), then a ``GAIA_REPO_ROOT`` override and the CWD,
which cover a non-editable install running from the repo checkout. It fails loud
with an actionable error if the fixture is absent from every candidate root.
