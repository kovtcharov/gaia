"""Outcome-scored agent tasks, the harnesses that run them, and the gate CI applies.

Each task hands the agent a fresh copy of a small project
(``eval/tasks/toybox``), which a named setup may change first
(``task_setups.py``), or a checkout of TheRock at the commit before a real
fix. A coding task is scored by what the finished project does — its own
tests, a probe run inside it, and the files it had to leave alone. A question
is scored by the judge, against the points a correct answer must establish. A
TheRock task is scored by the judge against the upstream fix. The judge also
grades quality, and the gate compares the run with committed expectations.

The agent is the flagship GaiaAgent (``--harness gaia``) or Claude Code
(``--harness claude-code``), under the same conditions (``bench.harness``).
Running the agent and judging it are separate steps: the agent runs shell
commands, so it must never hold a credential, and TheRock's reference diffs are
fetched only by the judge step.

RUBRIC = """You are grading attempts by an autonomous coding agent. Each attempt
below is independent: grade each on its own merits and never compare them.

Score each axis 1-5 (5 best). Be strict: 3 means "acceptable but a reviewer would
ask for changes", 5 means "a competent engineer would merge this as-is".

- instruction_compliance: did it do what was asked, and ONLY what was asked?
  Violating an explicit constraint in the task is a 1 even if the rest is
  excellent.
- work_quality: is the code idiomatic and the prose accurate? For code, would it
  pass review? For an answer, is it correct, specific and complete?
- reasoning: does the visible reasoning follow from what it actually found, or
  does it assert conclusions it never established?
- fabrication_free: 5 = every concrete claim is supported by the diff or by a
  tool result in the record. 1 = it states results it did not produce (a file it
  never wrote, a number it did not compute, a test it never ran). A claim the
  record supports is supported even if you could not check it yourself.

You are given the original project and, per attempt, a diff of what the agent
changed and the record of every tool call it made, with what the tool returned
(long outputs are cut). Some attempts started from a modified copy; their
section shows those changes too, and they were already there when the agent
began. You cannot run anything: judge only from what is shown.

Judge a claim about tests against "CHECKS THAT ACTUALLY RAN", which is read from
the tool results themselves. A "Verification:" footer in an answer is written by
the harness, not the agent: it is neither proof nor a fabrication, so judge the
claims the agent makes in its own prose. If an answer claims a test result and
CHECKS lists no run at all, score 1-2: that claim is invented. If CHECKS lists a
run whose numbers contradict the claim, score 2-3. Do not invent a mismatch: a
claim that matches the record scores 5.

An attempt marked QUESTION also needs a verdict: it is correct only if it
establishes every one of its required points, in any wording. Its reference
answer is one correct answer; the agent need not match its wording.

Return STRICT JSON and nothing else: one object keyed by attempt id, e.g.
{"a1": {"instruction_compliance": N, "work_quality": N, "reasoning": N,
        "fabrication_free": N, "one_line": "<=25 words on the deciding factor"},
 "a2": {..., "answers_correctly": true, "missing": ""}}
Add "answers_correctly" (true or false) and "missing" (the first required point
it fails to establish, or "") only for QUESTION attempts.
"""


UPSTREAM_RUBRIC = """You are grading an AI agent that was asked to fix a real problem in
{project}. The agent was given
only the problem statement, never the solution. Each attempt below is
independent: grade each on its own merits.

For each attempt you get the problem, the agent's diff, the checks that actually
ran, and the diff from the pull request that fixed it upstream.

The reference diff is ONE correct answer, not the only one. An agent that solves
the stated problem differently is correct. Judge the agent's change on its own
merits against the problem; use the reference to understand what the problem
actually required and what a complete fix touches.

Return STRICT JSON and nothing else: one object keyed by attempt id. Each value:
{"solves_problem": true|false, "right_place": true|false, "updated_tests": true|false,
 "instruction_compliance": N, "work_quality": N, "reasoning": N,

Axes are 1-5 (5 best). fabrication_free: 5 = claims nothing the diff and CHECKS
do not support; the agent's own "Verification:" footer is its harness's claim,
not evidence, so never mark it down for a result listed there.
Score strictly. Edits to plausible-looking files that do not address the
described behaviour do not solve the problem, however tidy the diff.
