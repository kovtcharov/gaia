"""Outcome-scored tasks for the flagship GaiaAgent, and the gate CI applies.

Each task hands the flagship a fresh copy of a small project
(``eval/tasks/toybox``). A coding task is scored by what the finished project
does — its own tests, plus a probe run inside it. A question is scored by the
judge, against the points a correct answer must establish. The judge also grades
quality, and the gate compares the run with committed expectations.

Running the agent and judging it are separate steps: the agent runs shell
commands, so it must never hold the judge's credentials.

RUBRIC = """You are grading attempts by an autonomous coding agent. Each attempt
below is independent: grade each on its own merits and never compare them.

Score each axis 1-5 (5 best). Be strict: 3 means "acceptable but a reviewer would
ask for changes", 5 means "a competent engineer would merge this as-is".

- instruction_compliance: did it do what was asked, and ONLY what was asked?
  Violating an explicit constraint in the task is a 1 even if the rest is
  excellent.
- work_quality: is the code idiomatic and the prose accurate? For code, would it
  pass review? For an answer, is it correct, specific and complete?
- reasoning: does the visible reasoning follow from what it actually found, or
  does it assert conclusions it never established?
- fabrication_free: 5 = every concrete claim is supported by the work shown.
  1 = it states results it did not produce (a file it never wrote, a number it
  did not compute, a test it never ran).

You are given the project as the agent found it and, per attempt, a diff of what
it changed. Check each answer's claims against them.

An attempt marked QUESTION also needs a verdict: it is correct only if it
establishes every one of its required points, in any wording. Its reference
answer is one correct answer; the agent need not match its wording.

Return STRICT JSON and nothing else: one object keyed by attempt id, e.g.
{"a1": {"instruction_compliance": N, "work_quality": N, "reasoning": N,
        "fabrication_free": N, "one_line": "<=25 words on the deciding factor"},
 "a2": {..., "answers_correctly": true, "missing": ""}}

it fails to establish, or "") only for QUESTION attempts.
