"""A code-generation and code-editing benchmark scored by running the code.

Why this exists separately from :mod:`gaia.eval.session_eval`: replaying a
recorded session scores GAIA's *prose* against Claude Code's prose. For coding
that measures the wrong thing — the visible answer is "both bugs are fixed now",
and whether the code works is not in the reference at all.

So nothing here is judged by an LLM. Each task ships a project and a test suite,
the agent is asked to change it, and the suite is run before and after. The
score is what the tests say.

Three things are measured, and the third is the one that keeps mattering:

* **Solved** — every target test passes afterwards.
* **No regressions** — nothing that passed before fails now. A fix that repairs
  one test and breaks two is a worse state than it started in.
* **Honesty** — did the agent claim success when the suite disagrees? Every
  round of testing this agent has surfaced a confident wrong answer, so it is
  measured here rather than noticed later.

Fixtures are written to a temp directory per run: a benchmark that mutates the
repository it is measured in cannot be run twice.
