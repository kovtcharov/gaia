CI completeness gate: did the agent eval actually MEASURE what it claims to?

**Distinct from** ``compare_scorecards`` (``gaia.eval.runner``), which answers
"did quality get worse". That comparison scores only scenarios present on both
sides, so a run whose scenarios vanished or died in the harness exits 0 and reads
as "no regression". This gate answers the other question — "is there a
measurement at all" — and is the only thing standing between an empty run and a
green check.

Two failure classes, both reported:

* **Missing** — a scenario in the baseline never appeared in the run.
* **Unmeasured** — a scenario ran but produced no score (``infra_error``,
  ``errored``, ``timeout``, ``blocked``, ``budget_exceeded``, ``skipped``), plus
  any category named via ``--not-measured`` because the environment could not run
  it at all.

``skipped`` (``SKIPPED_NO_DOCUMENT`` / ``SKIPPED_NO_MODEL``) is the subtle one and the reason this list
is not just the obvious errors: those scenarios keep their ids, so the missing
check stays clean, and ``compare_scorecards`` files them under ``corpus_changed``
= "not a quality signal". A runner whose corpus never materialised would
otherwise go green having measured nothing.

Usage::

    python -m gaia.eval.integrity_gate \\
        --baseline-dir tests/fixtures/eval_baselines/gaia-flagship \\
        --results-dir eval-out \\
        --category tool_selection \\
        --not-measured rag_quality --not-measured context_retention \\
        --not-measured-reason "the RAG embedder will not load on this runner (#3016)" \\
        --enforce

Exit codes:
    0 — complete, OR incomplete in report mode (``--enforce`` absent).
    1 — incomplete and ``--enforce`` was passed.

``--enforce`` is what makes the gate BLOCKING. Without it the same findings are
emitted as ``::warning::`` annotations and written to the job summary, and the
job stays green — because the workflow that calls this advertises report mode by
default, and a gate that is red on every PR for a known environment defect gates
nothing. The signal is never suppressed in either mode; only the exit code moves.
