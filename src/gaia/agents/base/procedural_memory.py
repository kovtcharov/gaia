ProceduralMemoryMixin: procedural-memory orchestration for MemoryMixin (#887).

Extracted from ``memory.py`` to keep the procedural-memory layer (the
procedures FAISS index, skill recall, and skill synthesis) cohesive in one
module.  This is the orchestration half of the procedural loop; the pure
pipeline lives in ``skill_synthesis.py`` and the data access in
``memory_store.py``.

Not used standalone — ``MemoryMixin`` subclasses it, and every method here
resolves on a ``MemoryMixin`` host via the MRO.

        The Step-8 driver of the procedural-memory loop, run once per process
        inside ``_run_memory_post_init`` (off the request hot path).  It wires the
        pure ``skill_synthesis`` pipeline to the live seams: DETECT via
        ``MemoryStore.iter_sessions``, CLUSTER via the 768-dim embedder
        (``_embed_text``), DISTILL via ``self.chat.send_messages``, and
        RECONCILE/STORE into the ``procedures`` table, adding each new row's
        ``when_to_use`` vector to the separate procedures FAISS index.

        Off-states (``docs/plans/skill-synthesis.mdx``): no store
        (``GAIA_MEMORY_DISABLED``) -> no-op; synthesis disabled in
        ``memory_settings.json`` -> skip + log INFO; no chat SDK -> skip + log.

        Fail-loud: an embedder failure re-raises (synthesis cannot proceed
        without embeddings); a distillation LLM call that raises (Lemonade
        unreachable) aborts the whole pass + logs; a malformed distill output
        skips only that cluster.  No smaller-model fallback in any path.
