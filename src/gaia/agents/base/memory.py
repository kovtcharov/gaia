MemoryMixin: Persistent memory for any GAIA agent (v2).

Hooks into the Agent lifecycle at 3 points:
1. System prompt injection (get_memory_system_prompt)
2. Tool execution wrapper (_execute_tool) — auto-logs calls + learns from errors
3. Post-query storage (_after_process_query) — stores conversations + LLM extraction

Provides 5 LLM-facing tools: remember, recall, update_memory, forget, search_past_conversations.
Valid categories: fact, preference, error, skill, note, reminder, system.

v2 additions:
- Embedding pipeline (Lemonade EmbeddingGemma 300M, 768-dim)
- FAISS IndexFlatIP for cosine similarity search
- Hybrid search: vector + BM25 + RRF fusion + cross-encoder reranking
- Complexity-aware recall depth (3/5/10 top_k)
- Mem0-style LLM extraction (ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP)
- Conversation consolidation (old sessions → knowledge)
- Background memory reconciliation (Hindsight-inspired)

Usage:
    class MyAgent(MemoryMixin, Agent):   # MemoryMixin MUST come before Agent
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            self.init_memory()          # Before super().__init__()
            super().__init__(**kwargs)

        def _register_tools(self):
            super()._register_tools()
            self.register_memory_tools()

operations to perform. Return a JSON array only.

Each item must have an "op" field:
- "add": New knowledge not already in memory
  Required: {{op, category, content, grounded, entity?, domain?, confidence: 0.4}}
- "update": Modify an existing memory item (correction, enrichment, or supersession)
  Required: {{op, knowledge_id, content, grounded, entity?, domain?}}
- "delete": Remove a memory item contradicted or invalidated by new information
  Required: {{op, knowledge_id, reason, grounded}}
- "noop": Information already captured accurately. Do not include in output.

"grounded" says where the knowledge comes from:
- "user": the user stated it in their message
- "tool": a tool result in the tool record shows it
Knowledge that only the assistant's answer asserts is not grounded. The answer
can be wrong. Do not store it.
