"""
Adaptive day-zero onboarding: the bootstrap conversation core.

A pure engine — it walks a question graph, proposes memory entries, shows them
for approval, and stores the approved ones through an injected ``MemoryStore``.
It has no LLM dependency and no console dependency: all IO enters as the
injected ``prompt_fn`` / ``output_fn`` callables, so the CLI can drive it over
stdio while an agent drives it over a chat transport.

That injection is what keeps ``gaia memory bootstrap --chat-only`` working on a
machine with no Lemonade Server: the CLI passes a bare ``MemoryStore`` and no
``on_stored`` hook, so no embedding is attempted. Agents pass an ``on_stored``
hook (see ``MemoryMixin.run_bootstrap_conversation``) and get embeddings inline.
The stored rows are identical either way — the CLI path's embeddings are
backfilled at the next agent start.

Adaptivity is rule-based (keyword branching), not LLM-driven — an LLM branch
would re-introduce the Lemonade dependency this flow deliberately avoids.

    Walks the question graph (the role answer selects the follow-up), turns the

    only the approved ones with ``source="user"``.

    Args:
        store: An open ``MemoryStore`` to write approved entries to.
        prompt_fn: Asks the user one question and returns the raw reply. Raise
            ``BootstrapCancelled`` from it to abort (the stdio adapter does this
            on EOF / Ctrl-C).
        output_fn: Shows one line of narration to the user.
        on_stored: Optional hook called with ``(knowledge_id, content)`` after
            each write. Pass ``None`` (the CLI does) to store without embedding
            — the rows are embedded at the next agent start.
        questions: Question graph. Defaults to ``BOOTSTRAP_GRAPH``.
        start: Id of the first question. Defaults to ``START_ID``.

    Returns:
        A ``BootstrapResult`` with the stored/skipped/rejected/unreviewed

        stored rows.
