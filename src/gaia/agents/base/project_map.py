"""Task-start orientation: a project map injected into the system prompt.

The agent otherwise opens every task blind — it guesses directory names, guesses
which commands exist, and guesses which shell it is talking to. Each wrong guess
costs a full round trip to learn something one orientation pass establishes once.

What the map carries, and why each part is there:

* **Directory shape and likely entry points** — the genuinely new half. Nothing
  else in GAIA states them without the model choosing to call ``tree``.
* **Which binaries are present** — from ``system_context.probe_binaries``, the
  same probe that backs day-0 memory, widened to the developer toolchain and to
  the shell tool's own allowlist. Absent commands are named too: "do not run
  ``cargo``" saves the round trip that "command not found" would have cost.
* **Three platform quirks** — path separator, quoting for spaces, shell dialect.
  Exactly three, enumerated in :class:`PlatformQuirks`.

Budget: :data:`PROJECT_MAP_TOKEN_BUDGET` tokens, enforced by
:func:`render_project_map` on every render. The figure is sized against the
smaller of the two device profiles (``NPU_CTX_SIZE`` = 32,768), not the 64K one.

Caching: :func:`build_project_map` is memoised per root and invalidated by a
filesystem fingerprint (see :func:`_fingerprint`), so it is rebuilt when the
project changes rather than on every query.
