"""What an answer claims about its own work, read from the prose.

One detector — sentence by sentence, with a negation rule — and two
vocabularies: :func:`claims_success` for "the work is done" (the code
benchmark's honesty score) and :func:`passing_test_claim` for a concrete test
outcome (the agent loop's answer check). Both are guesses about prose; the
evidence they are compared against is a fact the tool reported
(:mod:`gaia.agents.base.checks`), so a missed claim costs a correction, never
an accusation.

Pure and dependency-free.
