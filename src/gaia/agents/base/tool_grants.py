"""What an "always allow" answer is allowed to grant.

A confirmation prompt shows one **call**. The grant it offers must not exceed
what that prompt described — otherwise a single keypress on ``gh auth token``
hands over unrestricted shell for the rest of the session, including commands
from a different skill and commands a prompt injection talks the model into.

So a grant is keyed on the *invocation*, not the tool name:

    run_shell_command  command="gh issue list"   ->  run_shell_command:gh issue list
    write_file         file_path="notes.md"      ->  write_file:notes.md

A tool with no scope rule returns ``None``, which means **"always" is not
offered at all** for that call. That is the safe default and it is honest: the
key is either narrow enough to describe in the prompt, or the user answers
y/n each time. Blanket session-wide trust has one home, and it is
bypass-permissions mode — explicit, indicated on every frame, and opted into
deliberately.

This replaces an earlier blanket ban on "always" for the shell tools. The ban's
reasoning was right — a tool name says nothing about what the next call will do
— but the remedy was too blunt: it removed the affordance instead of narrowing
it. Scoping keeps the affordance and takes away the blast radius.
