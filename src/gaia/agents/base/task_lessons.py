"""What this task has taught the agent about its environment, kept in view.

A refusal or a tool failure is visible once, in the result of the call that
hit it, and then scrolls up the conversation. A model probing for a way
forward walks into the same wall again several steps later. Each failure is
recorded here as a lesson — what failed and why, and what later worked for the
same program — and the whole list rides on every later failed result, so the
constraints learned so far are in front of the model exactly when it is
exploring.

The lessons come from the harness's own records of what ran, never from the
content a tool returned, so a fetched page cannot write one. They last for the
turn.
