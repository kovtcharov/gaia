"""Verification-scope statement appended to every emitted answer (#3376).

The agent loop used to report "done" in the same confident language whether it
ran the test suite or ran nothing at all. Every emitted answer now carries one
line saying which — derived from the turn's own tool-execution log, so it costs
no extra model call.

The line rides in the answer, which the surfaces persist and re-send as
conversation history, so it is HARD-CAPPED at ``VERIFICATION_SCOPE_MAX_CHARS``.
:func:`strip_verification_scope` removes it again for consumers that need the
answer text alone.

Pure and dependency-free on purpose: the agent loop, the Agent-UI SSE handler,
and hub agents all consume it.
