"""ToolLoader — per-turn semantic tool selection for agents (#1449, parent #688).

Gates which tools appear in the LLM prompt each turn without ever changing the
global ``_TOOL_REGISTRY``. The registry stays the source of truth for *all*
registered tools and for execution; the loader only picks the subset that the
prompt renderers (text and native) surface to the model.

Selection model (binding — see the design sketch in #688)
--------------------------------------------------------
Per turn the loader computes ``CORE ∪ SKILL ∪ SEMANTIC(query)`` then pulls in
whole bundles for any semantically-matched member, and accumulates the result
into a session-scoped *loaded set* that only grows ("expand-on-new-match").
The set is returned in **admission order** — CORE in registry order, then every
later admission appended where it happened — and never re-sorted, so a new tool
only ever adds bytes at the end. Combined with the monotonic set, that keeps a
non-expansion turn byte-identical AND keeps an expansion turn's prefix intact,
so the model backend's KV prefix cache stays warm through both.

* **CORE** — a small always-on set, admitted unconditionally and exempt from
  the cap and from eviction.
* **SKILL** — the exact ``tools_required`` of any learned procedure the host
  recalled for this goal (procedural memory, #887/#1451), passed in as plain
  tool names via ``select(skill_tools=...)``. Admitted **after CORE, ahead of
  semantic** (precedence ``CORE > SKILL > SEMANTIC``), cap-bound (NOT
  cap-exempt) and with no bundle pull-in — a high-precision booster that fires
  only for goals solved before. Empty/absent on every off-state, leaving the
  loaded set byte-identical to a CORE+SEMANTIC build.
* **SEMANTIC** — cosine similarity (dot product over L2-normalized embeddings)
  of the query against ``"{name}: {description}"`` for every registered tool;
  a tool matches at ``score >= threshold`` (inclusive).
* **Bundles** — cohesion groups with *no* activation policy. When any member
  matches, the whole bundle is pulled in so related tools arrive together.
* **Bounded monotonic set** — below ``max_tools`` the loaded set is strictly
  monotonic; at the cap a non-CORE tool is LRU-evicted (oldest last-call,
  falling back to load-time for never-called tools). CORE and any tool admitted
  this turn are eviction-exempt. Evicted tools may be re-admitted later — the
  one and only monotonicity exception. Eviction happens **only at a turn
  boundary** (inside :meth:`select`): mid-turn the set is add-only, because
  dropping a tool from the middle of the list re-prefills every tool after it.
  A mid-turn :meth:`load_bundle` may therefore overshoot the cap until the next
  turn trims it back.

The loader never imports ``MemoryMixin``; the embedding function(s) are injected
by the host agent. Any embedding failure session-disables the loader with a
loud log (mirrors memory v2), and the caller reverts to the full registry.

Naming note: the class name ``ToolLoader`` and method ``reset_session()`` are
kept from the inert skeleton this replaced — existing call sites in ``cli.py``
and ``chat/app.py`` are ``hasattr``/``try``-guarded, so no call site changes.
