"""Inherited agent init: readiness probing and provisioning, declared not coded.

An agent states what it needs — a model id, a minimum backend version — and gets
``GET``/``POST /v1/<id>/init`` from :class:`~gaia.agents.base.server.AgentServer`
for free. Before this module every agent that wanted a readiness contract had to
hand-write both verbs; the email sidecar did, and was the only one that had them.

Two verbs, deliberately asymmetric:

* **GET** — read-only. Probes the backend and reports a structured status with an
  actionable ``hint`` per failure. Never pulls, never installs, never mutates.
* **POST** — provisioning. Tells an *already-running* backend to download the
  declared model, streaming newline-terminated progress so a consumer can render
  it terminal-style.

**Where the boundary sits.** Inherited init makes *this agent's* requirements
ready: its model, against a backend that is already up. Installing the backend
itself stays with ``gaia init`` — an agent process cannot bootstrap the server it
depends on, and pretending otherwise would turn a clear error into a hang. When
the backend is unreachable both verbs fail loudly and name whose job the fix is;
:func:`provision_progress` is never even reached. Do not grow an installer here.

**Why the final line decides a pull, not the status code.** Once a streamed 200
is committed the status can no longer change, so a pull that fails half-way still
arrives as ``200 OK``. The last line carries the verdict: ``✓`` success, ``✗``
failure, ``⚠`` succeeded-but-unverified. Consumers must read it rather than the
status. The TUI's preflight gate already does (``tui/internal/ui/preflight``).

# Test-only hold on model reporting (#2539): Lemonade lazily reloads an
# unloaded model on the next inference request, which makes "model unavailable"
# un-testable through these probes alone — by the time a second check runs, a
# query elsewhere may have already triggered the reload. Setting this env var to
# a comma-separated list of model ids (or "*" for all) makes this module report
# those ids as absent regardless of what Lemonade actually answers, so the
# preflight gate's "model unavailable" messaging can be exercised on demand.
#
# The hold covers BOTH halves of the readiness picture, because they drive
# different rows and only one of them produces the failing gate: it strips the
# ids from ``all_models_loaded`` (which feeds the ctx-size annotation) AND makes
# ``probe_model_present`` report them absent (which is what actually fails the
# gate). Holding only the first yields a green row with no ctx — the bug #3853
# describes. A held id therefore also fails POST provisioning's post-pull verify,
# which is the honest result: the hook says this model is not there.
#
# This never touches real inference: the production callers are the read-only
# ``GET /v1/<id>/init`` readiness route and its POST provisioning counterpart
# (``gaia.agents.base.server``) — nothing in the actual chat/query path reads
# these return values. Unset in every normal install/run.
