"""Shared "agent wheel not installed" messaging.

The ``gaia-agent-*`` wheels (gaia, chat, email) are built
and packaged (``hub/agents/<id>/python/``) but publishing them to PyPI is
still paused (see ``.github/workflows/publish_agents.yml``, tracked by
#1179 / #1513). Until that lands, ``pip install gaia-agent-<id>`` and
``pip install "amd-gaia[agents]"`` both fail on a clean environment (#2240)
-- so every call site that used to recommend them needs to point at the one
install path that actually resolves today: pip installing straight from the
package's subdirectory in this repo.

    ``uv`` Python module, so hard-coding ``uv pip install`` here would just
    move the #2240 dead end from ``pip install gaia-agent-<id>`` to this
    hint's own recommended command. ``python -m pip`` is the one frontend
    every stock venv provides (the same last-resort fallback
    ``InitCommand._install_pip_extras`` already uses for this reason).
