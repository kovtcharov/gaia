            Edit a file by replacing old content with new content.

            Similar to Claude Code's Edit tool — performs a partial string replacement

            old_content must match exactly one location. Zero or several matches
            are errors that carry the file's current content, so a retry does not
            need a separate read.

            3. Sensitive file protection
