"""Let the agent improve a loaded skill from what it learned (#2674).

One model-facing tool, ``remember_skill_lesson``. It writes to the **learned
overlay** in agent memory; the authored ``SKILL.md`` on disk is never touched.

A correction **applies immediately** — an agent that has to ask permission to
act on what it just learned is not adaptive. What replaces the permission
prompt is transparency: every write says what changed and prints the exact
command that undoes it, and nothing is ever deleted.

Four limits, each closing a way this could go wrong:

* **Replace only, never remove.** The model may correct a command or rewrite a
  procedure that does not fit; it may not delete a section. Removal is a human
  action through ``gaia skill deltas`` — otherwise a confidently wrong model
  could quietly drop the rules that constrain it.
* **The user's words, not a fetched page's.** A stored lesson outlives the turn
  it arrived in, so it may only come from a turn in which nothing but the user
  has spoken. ``Agent.turn_content_provenance`` reports that, and
  ``validate_delta`` refuses anything else — which is what stops a web page, an
  email, or an issue body from writing itself into the agent's standing
  instructions.
* **Undoable, and said out loud.** The write is announced on the console and
  names ``gaia skill deltas <skill> --revert <id>``. Reverting archives the row
  rather than deleting it, and ``--reset`` returns the skill to as-shipped.
* **Bounded.** A lesson that would make the resolved skill materially larger
  than the authored one is refused at write time with the reason, rather than
  silently trimmed later. Learning is not allowed to become a prompt tax — the
  case that motivated this feature was a skill hand-patched to fit, which made
  it permanently longer without making it a better match.

Kept out of :mod:`gaia.agents.tools.skill_library_tools` on purpose: that mixin
is composed by every agent that wants skills, and one more always-registered
tool schema costs prompt tokens for agents that will never learn. This one is
opt-in as ``KNOWN_TOOLS["skill_learning"]``.
