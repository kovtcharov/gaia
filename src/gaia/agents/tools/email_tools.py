"""
Email Tools — read-only mailbox access for the flagship agent.

Gives an agent the ability to list, search, and read mail from a connected
mailbox so a skill (``hub/skills/inbox-triage``) can do the judging. The tools
deliberately return facts, not verdicts: categorisation is the model's job,
driven by the skill, which is the whole point of moving email onto the flagship
rather than shipping a second agent with its own classifier.

Read-only by design. Nothing here archives, sends, or deletes; write verbs
arrive with the reversible-action ledger in a later phase. See
``docs/plans/email-triage-skill.mdx``.

Provider support: Gmail and Outlook / Microsoft Graph, behind one set of tool
names. Both backends return the same provider-neutral shape, so neither the
skill nor the model has to care which mailbox is connected.

Selection is connector-derived and has no override: a mailbox is eligible only
if it is connected, carries a read scope, and this agent holds a grant for it.
With both eligible, Gmail wins on registry order, and the way to change that is
to revoke the grant — not to set an environment variable, which would bypass
the gate that makes any of this checkable. The one exception is the scenario
eval's offline fixture mailbox (``GAIA_EVAL_MAILBOX``, see ``_email/fixture.py``),
which replaces the mailbox outright rather than choosing between real ones.
