Tools that get a skill's CLI installed and signed in, instead of giving up.

A skill that needs GitHub declares ``shell:execute:gh`` and GAIA gates every
``gh`` command it runs. That works right up until ``gh`` is not on the machine,
or is on it but logged out — at which point the agent's only move was to tell
the user to go and fix it themselves. This mixin removes that dead end: the
agent can find out exactly what is wrong, offer to install the CLI, and walk the
user through signing in.

Three tools, matching the three things that can be true:

* ``check_cli_setup`` — read-only, no prompt. Runs the CLI's own status command
  and reports one of five states. Always the first call: it is what tells the
  model which of the other two to reach for, and reaching for one in the wrong
  state costs the user an approval prompt for a no-op.
* ``install_cli`` — installs it, **after the user approves the exact command**.
* ``sign_in_cli`` — starts the browser sign-in and hands the user the one-time
  code, then confirms it worked.

**The model picks which CLI, never what runs.** Both mutating tools take a
*binary name* that must be a key in ``BINARY_POLICIES``; the command itself is
read from that table. There is no argument through which a command, a flag, or
a URL can be injected — the ``command`` argument exists only so the exact text
appears in the approval prompt, and a value that does not match the table's
refuses the call rather than running.

Why a tool rather than widening ``run_shell_command``: adding ``winget`` /
``brew`` / ``apt`` to the shell allowlist would let the model install *anything*
it could name, gated by a prompt whose fatigue is the known failure mode. A tool
that can install exactly the CLIs GAIA has policies for is a far smaller grant
than a package manager, and it is the same size no matter how many skills use it.
