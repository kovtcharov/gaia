"""BrowserUseToolsMixin — a real browser the agent can act in.

Complements :class:`~gaia.agents.tools.browser_tools.BrowserToolsMixin` rather
than replacing it. ``fetch_page`` is one HTTP GET and costs ~200 ms; this
carries a live Chromium. Most reading should still go through ``fetch_page``.
This is for what that cannot do: pages behind a login, and pages that only
exist after JavaScript runs.

Six tools, deliberately. Every tool schema is ~155 prompt tokens and the model
prefills at ~387 tok/s, so each one costs ~0.4 s on every LLM call that sees
it. They live in a lazy bundle for that reason.

Talks to Playwright's Python API directly — no MCP hop, no subprocess, no JSON
round trip. The browser is launched once and reused for the session.
