"""Private, per-install Lemonade Server for GAIA.

Upstream ships an "embeddable" Lemonade build: a ``lemond`` daemon plus a
``lemonade`` HTTP client, with no installer, no tray app and no machine-wide
state. This module downloads that artifact, unpacks it under ``~/.gaia``, and
runs it on a private port behind a generated API key.

The point is a GAIA that carries its own inference server. The system-wide
Lemonade install keeps working and stays the fallback -- see
``gaia.llm.lemonade_launcher`` for that path.

Layout under ``$GAIA_HOME/lemonade`` (``~/.gaia/lemonade`` by default)::

    dist/<version>/     unpacked artifact (lemond, lemonade, resources/)
    cache/              lemond cache_dir -- downloaded backends live in bin/
    config/config.json  lemond config_dir
    state.json          the running instance: pid, port, API key, version
    lemond.log          daemon stdout/stderr

``cache/`` and ``config/`` are deliberately *not* versioned: backends run from
141 MB (llama.cpp CPU + Vulkan) to 4.3 GB (ROCm, which also pulls a per-GPU
TheRock runtime), and re-downloading them on every Lemonade bump is not
acceptable. lemond invalidates stale binaries itself via the
``clear_bin_if_lemonade_below`` pin in its ``backend_versions.json``.
