"""Ask Fireworks what it serves, rather than what a gateway chose to expose.

GAIA reaches Fireworks through Lemonade's cloud routing, and Lemonade advertises
a discovered subset — 24 models on a current install, with no Gemma at all and
3 of roughly 25 Qwen 3.x variants (lemonade-sdk/lemonade#3570). A model missing
from that subset cannot be requested: Lemonade answers ``model_not_found``. So
"which models could I run" had no answer short of reading a vendor web page.

This module asks the provider directly. It only ever *reads* the catalogue —
inference still goes through the configured backend — so the two can be compared
and the gap named instead of guessed at.

Needs a Fireworks key of GAIA's own: the one Lemonade uses lives in its process
and is not readable from here.
