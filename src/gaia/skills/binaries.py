The ``shell:execute:<binary>`` bridge — a skill brings its own CLI.

A skill that needs GitHub does not need a bespoke connector; it needs ``gh``.
Declaring ``shell:execute:gh`` in ``SKILL.md`` grants **that one binary**, to
**that one skill's session**, on **that one agent instance**, restricted to the
subcommands named in :data:`BINARY_POLICIES` below.

Every invocation lands in exactly one of **three** tiers
(:func:`classify_invocation`):

* ``ALLOW`` — a read. Runs with no prompt: loading the skill is the consent, and
  a triage is five to ten reads.
* ``CONFIRM`` — a bounded write (``gh issue comment``). The user is shown the
  **exact command** and answers yes / no / always-for-this-command-class. It
  never runs on its own.
* ``REFUSE`` — never runs, and never raises a prompt. Reserved for the
  escalation classes a single yes/no cannot honestly describe: printing a
  credential (``gh auth token``), defining or installing code that then runs
  (``gh alias``, ``gh extension``, ``gh config``), and the unbounded generic
  surfaces (any ``gh api`` write, which is "do anything to any resource" behind
  one flag).

Keeping CONFIRM and REFUSE apart is the point. Collapsing them into one prompt
turns the gate into a habit — click yes, and yes covers ``gh auth token`` too.

Four properties make this safe enough to bridge while the general shell sandbox
is still deferred:

1. **Deny by default at two levels.** A binary with no entry here cannot be
   declared at all, and a subcommand absent from its entry is refused. Nothing is
   permitted by omission — and nothing is *confirmable* by omission either: a
   write reaches the CONFIRM tier only by being listed in ``confirm_actions``.
2. **No global state.** The grant lives on the agent instance
   (:class:`BinaryGrants`), never in a module-level allowlist. One agent's skill
   can never widen another agent's shell.
3. **A write executes only behind the agent's confirmation gate.** This module
   classifies; it does not enforce consent. ``Agent._execute_tool`` is what
   actually stops a CONFIRM call — the same single funnel that has always gated
   ``write_file`` — and ``ShellToolsMixin.skill_grant_covers_call`` exempts only
   the ALLOW tier from it. A caller wanting "may this run with nobody asked?"
   uses :func:`validate_invocation`, which answers no for CONFIRM and REFUSE
   alike, so an un-updated caller fails closed.
4. **Read-only by construction — for CLIs that talk to something *external*.**
   ``pytest`` is a different class of grant and says so in its own summary: it
   EXECUTES the project's own test code, the same trust boundary as the ungated
   ``execute_python_file`` tool. What its table restricts is invocation shape
   (no plugin injection, no interactive hang, no writes/paths outside the
   checkout) — never what the tests themselves do. It has no CONFIRM tier.

Adding a CLI is a data entry here plus a ``SKILL.md`` — never a new branch in the
shell tool. That is the acceptance test for this module: supporting GitLab must
be ``"glab": BinaryPolicy(...)`` and nothing else.

class Subcommand:
    """The rule for one ``<binary> <subcommand>`` pair — or, when set as

    Attributes:
        actions: Allowed third tokens (``gh issue **list**``), each running with
            no prompt. Empty plus ``free_form=False`` means the subcommand takes
            no action and any action token is refused.
        confirm_actions: Action tokens that WRITE and are offered to the user as
            a confirmable action rather than refused (``gh issue **create**``).
            Disjoint from *actions* by construction — an action in both would be
            silently read-only, which is the one mistake this table must not
            make quietly, so :meth:`__post_init__` refuses it.
        free_form: The subcommand's first positional is data, not an action
            (``gh api **repos/amd/gaia**``), so it is not matched against
            *actions*. ``denied_actions`` still applies.
        denied_actions: Action tokens refused even under ``free_form``.
        denied_flags: Flags refused outright, checked BEFORE the action is
            classified — so a denied flag refuses a confirmable write too, and
            no prompt is raised for it.
        flag_values: ``{flag: allowed lowercase values}``. A listed flag must
            carry one of those values (``--method GET``).
        value_flags: Flags that consume the following token. Needed so a flag's
            value is never mistaken for the action positional.
        path_operands: For :attr:`BinaryPolicy.positional` rules only — every
            non-flag token is a path operand (pytest's test paths), not a
            single subcommand action, and each is checked for a shape that
            could escape the project (absolute, drive-letter, or ``..``).
        allowed_flags: The valueless flags this grant accepts. Setting it turns
            flag checking into an ALLOWLIST — a flag absent from it, from
            ``value_flags``, from ``flag_values`` and from the policy's
            ``bare_flags`` is refused. Left empty (the default), unlisted flags
            fall through and only ``denied_flags`` applies. Always set for a
            :attr:`BinaryPolicy.positional` rule, whose binary executes the
            caller's arguments far more directly.
        flag_value_prefixes: For positional rules — ``{flag: allowed lowercase
            value prefixes}``. Like ``flag_values`` but for a flag whose safe
            values share a prefix rather than an exact set (``-p no:...``).
        denied_flag_reasons: ``{flag: one-line reason}`` shown in the refusal.
            Falls back to a generic message when absent. Used by both rule
            shapes — a denied flag has to say *why* it is denied or the model
            retries it verbatim.

#   codespace  opens a remote shell
