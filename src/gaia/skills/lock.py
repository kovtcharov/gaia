``skill-lock.json`` — the record of what ``gaia skill install`` actually installed.

Discovery (:class:`~gaia.skills.manager.SkillManager`) answers *what is on disk*.
The lock answers the questions a directory listing cannot: which hub version was
requested, which one resolved, what the artifact hashed to, who signed it, and
which tier it was **installed** at after the ceiling was applied. Without that,
``gaia skill install foo@^1.0`` is unauditable and unrepeatable — the front matter
alone cannot say whether a ``community`` stamp was earned or merely claimed.

The file lives at ``<skills root>/skill-lock.json`` (i.e. ``~/.gaia/skills/``, or
wherever ``GAIA_CONFIG_DIR`` points)::

    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "generated_at": "2026-07-30T12:00:00+00:00",
      "skills": {
        "web-research": {
          "name": "web-research",
          "version": "1.2.0",
          "requested": "^1.0",
          "source": "hub",
          "hub_url": "https://hub.amd-gaia.ai",
          "artifact_sha256": "…",
          "artifact_filename": "web-research-1.2.0.zip",
          "claimed_tier": "community",
          "installed_tier": "community",
          "attested_tier": "community",
          "signature": {"signed": true, "key_id": "…", "publisher": "acme",
                        "role": "publisher"},
          "permissions": ["network:read:*.brave.com"],
          "installed_at": "2026-07-30T12:00:00+00:00",
          "path": "/Users/me/.gaia/skills/web-research"
        }
      }
    }

Hub-installed skills and **captured** skills are tracked. A capture
(``source: "captured"``) records where the bundle came from (``origin``) and the
code-trust state (``captured`` / ``code_trusted``) that gates whether its
``tools.py`` may register — see :mod:`gaia.skills.capture`. A skill created with
``gaia skill create`` or copied in with ``gaia skill import`` has no provenance
to record, so inventing a lock entry for it would assert a source it does not
have.

A missing lock file is an **empty** lock, not an error — that is a machine with no
hub-installed skills. A *corrupt* one raises: silently starting over would drop
the provenance of skills that are still installed.
