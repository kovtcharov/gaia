``gaia skill publish ./my-skill/`` — validate, audit, sign, upload.

The order matters, and each step gates the next:

1. **Validate** the source against the real parser, so a skill that would fail to
   load can never enter the catalog.
2. **Refuse un-bridged permissions.** Publishing a skill that no GAIA release can
   load would be publishing a brick (#888 defers the local-capability sandbox).
3. **Audit** (#2468, via :mod:`gaia.skills.audit_gate`). If the engine is not
   installed and no report was supplied, publish **stops** — it does not proceed
   un-audited. The hub gates ``community``/``verified`` on that report, so
   fabricating one would launder an unscanned skill past the gate.
4. **Behaviour-validate** (via :mod:`gaia.skills.behavior_gate`). The audit says
   the skill is safe to run; this says it actually works. A skill with no record
   that its tools ever executed against a real model is refused, because a body
   the model silently ignores passes every static check and still ships broken.
   The record is bound to the skill's ``content_digest``, so an edit invalidates
   it — you cannot forget to re-validate.
5. **Sign** the staged bundle with a publisher Ed25519 key, embedding
   ``SIGNATURE.json``. Signing is what a skill's tier rests on at install time:
   an unsigned bundle installs at ``experimental`` no matter what its front matter
   claims, so publishing ``community`` unsigned would ship a claim nobody honors —
   hence :func:`publish_skill` refuses that combination up front rather than
   letting the publisher find out from a user's install log.
6. **Package** the signed directory into ``<name>-<version>.zip``.
7. **Upload** to ``POST /publish/skill`` as multipart (``skill`` / ``artifact`` /
   ``changelog`` / ``audit``) with a Bearer token — the contract from PR #2668.

The Worker re-validates everything server-side; these checks exist so the
publisher gets the actionable message *before* a failed upload, not after.
