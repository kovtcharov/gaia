Getting a skill's CLI onto the machine — install it, then log it in.

:mod:`gaia.skills.binaries` answers "may this command run?". This module answers
the question that comes *before* it: the command cannot run at all, because the
CLI is absent or logged out. Telling the user to go fix that by hand is a dead
end an agent is perfectly able to walk itself, once someone says yes.

Three moving parts, in the order they are used:

* :func:`detect` — which of five states the CLI is actually in. The states are
  kept apart because each needs a *different* remedy, and conflating two of
  them produces confident advice that cannot work: telling someone to run
  ``gh auth login`` when their token comes from ``$GH_TOKEN`` is telling them
  to run a command gh will refuse.
* :func:`install_plan` — the exact argv for this platform, or an honest "not on
  this OS, here is the URL". Never a shell string, never interpolated.
* :func:`start_device_login` / :class:`DeviceLogin` — drives the browser device
  flow far enough to hand the user their one-time code, then waits for them.

**What this module does not do is decide.** Installing software and logging in
to an account are the user's calls, and the confirmation gate that asks them
lives in ``Agent._execute_tool``, reached through
:mod:`gaia.agents.tools.cli_setup_tools`. Nothing here prompts, and nothing here
should ever be called without having asked first.

Adding self-setup for a second CLI is a :class:`~gaia.skills.binaries.BinarySetup`
entry in the policy table and nothing else — no new branch below. That is the
same acceptance test the invocation table sets for itself, and it is why the
login driver talks about "the one-time code" rather than about gh.

#: is logged or returned to the model. Belt and braces — none of the commands in
#: the policy table print a credential (``gh auth token`` is refused outright,
#: and ``auth status`` masks by default) — but "no command we run prints one" is
#: a property of today's table, and this is the one code path where a leak would
#: be both silent and permanent, because the model's context is the transcript.

#: the value beside it is redacted on the assumption it IS the code.
_CODE_LABEL_RE = re.compile(r"(one-time code:?)(.*)", re.IGNORECASE)

#: How long to wait for the CLI to print its device code before concluding the
#: flow is not going to start. Generous for a cold process on a slow box, short
