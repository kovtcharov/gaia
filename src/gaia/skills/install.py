``gaia skill install`` / ``remove`` — resolve, verify, gate, then write.

Every check runs **before** anything lands in the skills root, so a refused skill
leaves no partial install behind (the same property the loader guarantees for
tools). In order:

1. **Resolve** the version from the hub's per-skill manifest against the SemVer
   range the caller pinned (:mod:`gaia.skills.versions`).
2. **Download + checksum** the bundle against ``versions[v].artifact.sha256``.
3. **Unpack** into a temp dir, refusing any archive entry that escapes it.
4. **Parse** the raw ``SKILL.md`` — fetched from ``GET
   /skills/<name>/<version>/SKILL.md``, never from the catalog's ``readme``,
   which is a front-matter-stripped rendering.
5. **Verify the signature** over every bundled file, and resolve the trust role of
   the signing key (:mod:`gaia.skills.signing`).
6. **Collapse the tier** to ``min(claimed, attested)`` — this is what makes "no
   unsigned skill installs as ``verified``" structural rather than a rule someone
   has to remember.
7. **Refuse un-bridged permissions.** v1 bridges connector-backed domains only; a
   skill wanting ``filesystem``/``shell``/``database``/``desktop``/``env`` is
   refused, because the sandbox that would contain it does not exist yet (#888).
   A tier stamp is not a substitute for it.
8. **Enforce the permission ceiling** for the effective tier, then prompt for
   dangerous grants (``community``) or require ``--allow-experimental``.
9. **Copy in and re-stamp** the effective tier into the installed ``SKILL.md``,
   and record the whole decision in ``skill-lock.json``.

Steps 4/9 reuse ``gaia skill import``'s materialize → parse → copy → re-stamp
shape on purpose: one save path with one security behavior. Import always stamps
``experimental`` (it has no provenance to reason about); install stamps the tier
the signature earned.
