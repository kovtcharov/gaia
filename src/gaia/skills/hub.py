Client for the skills lane of the Agent Hub (the Cloudflare Worker + R2).

The skills lane is a *fourth lane of the existing hub*, not a second registry, so
this module speaks the contract PR #2668 locked in:

============================================  =============================================
Endpoint                                       Use
============================================  =============================================
``GET  /index.json``                           the whole catalog; skills are the
                                               entries with ``type: "skill"``
``GET  /skills/<name>/manifest.json``          every published version + artifact
                                               (``sha256``, size, R2 path)
``GET  /skills/<name>/<version>/SKILL.md``     the raw ``SKILL.md`` for a version
``GET  /skills/<name>/<version>/<filename>``   the bundle artifact
``POST /publish/skill``                        multipart publish (Bearer auth)
============================================  =============================================

**The installer reads ``SKILL.md`` from R2, never from the catalog.** A skill
entry's ``readme`` field carries the instruction body for the hub page to render,
but the Worker strips its front matter to build it — so it is a *rendering* of the
skill, not the skill. Installing from it would drop the manifest entirely. The
raw object is the source of truth, and this module's :func:`fetch_skill_doc` is
the only path the installer uses.

Catalog reads reuse :mod:`gaia.hub.catalog` (its cache, its offline fallback, its
``skill_entries`` filter) rather than re-fetching ``index.json`` independently.
