VLMToolsMixin - Vision Language Model tools for image analysis.

Provides generic VLM capabilities that can be used across any GAIA agent:
- Image description and analysis
- Question answering about images

Example:

    from gaia.vlm import VLMToolsMixin

    class MyVisionAgent(Agent, VLMToolsMixin):
        def __init__(self):

        def _register_tools(self):
            '''Required abstract method - VLM tools already registered in __init__.'''
            pass

        def _get_system_prompt(self):
            return "You analyze images. Use analyze_image or answer_question_about_image tools."
