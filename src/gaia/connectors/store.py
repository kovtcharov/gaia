"""
Keyring-backed persistent storage for OAuth connection records.

Single-blob design (plan amendment A5):
    Each ``(provider, account_email)`` tuple maps to ONE keyring entry that
    stores a JSON blob containing ``refresh_token``, ``account_email``,
    ``scopes``, ``connected_at``, and ``client_id_hash``. A single
    ``set_password`` call atomically replaces the entry, so a partial-write
    failure cannot leave us with a fresh token + stale metadata.

Backend allowlist (plan amendment A4):
    Plaintext or weak file-backed keyring backends (e.g. ``keyrings.alt``'s
    ``PlaintextKeyring``, ``EncryptedKeyring``, ``Win32CryptoKeyring``) are
    explicitly refused BEFORE any write. Linux machines without
    SecretService produce an actionable error pointing at the runbook
    instead of silently writing tokens to disk in plaintext.

Eager ``client_id_hash`` tripwire (plan amendment from Iteration 1, AC10):
    Every ``load_connection`` compares the stored hash against the current
    one. A mismatch means the OAuth client was rotated (or the user moved
    their installation between machines with different env configurations);
    we clear the stored entry, emit ``connection.revoked``, and return
    ``None`` so the caller raises ``REAUTH_REQUIRED``.

All log statements in this module emit only metadata (provider IDs, counts,
truncated fingerprints) — never tokens, passwords, or full hashes.

# Windows Credential Manager caps a single credential blob at 2560 bytes
# (CRED_MAX_CREDENTIAL_BLOB_SIZE). keyring stores the value as UTF-16, so the
# practical ceiling is ~1280 chars — and CredWrite fails with a cryptic
# "The stub received bad data" (error 1783) past it. Google refresh tokens
# (~100 chars) never came close, so this went unnoticed; Microsoft Graph
# refresh tokens (~1600 chars) blow straight past it. We transparently split
# an oversized value across extra keyring slots (``<username>#<idx>``) and
# reassemble on read. Small values stay in a single raw slot — backward
# compatible with every pre-existing entry and the short Google blobs.
#
# Torn-write safety: keyring has no atomic multi-slot transaction, and
# Microsoft rotates the refresh token on every refresh (varying length →
# varying chunk count), so an overwrite can crash mid-rewrite with slots and
# manifest out of sync. The manifest therefore carries a CRC32 of the full
# payload; ``_kr_get`` validates the reassembled value against it and returns
# ``None`` ("reconnect") on any mismatch — a torn state can never surface as a
# truncated-but-valid-looking token.

    guarantee (per Iteration 1 fix C5).

    v1 single-account-per-provider scope (per plan amendment A10): the

    the JSON blob for display purposes only. **A second

    ``account_type`` records what KIND of account signed in when the provider
    can tell (Microsoft derives ``personal`` / ``work`` from the id_token ``tid``
    claim, #2466). Distinct from ``tenant``, which records the authority the app
    signed in *against*: the ``common`` authority admits both kinds, so the two
    answer different questions. Omitted from the blob when ``None`` — an absent
    key means "unknown", which readers must handle explicitly rather than
    assuming a kind. Callers that re-save an existing connection (e.g.
    refresh-token rotation) MUST pass both values through or they are lost.
