"""Authored setup-walkthrough content for guided mailbox onboarding (#2590).

The problem this replaces: connecting Outlook meant sending someone to
Microsoft's developer portal with a single paragraph of instructions and no
way to tell whether they actually got it right. This module is the single
source of truth for what the walkthrough says, step by step, so the content
lives in ONE place — not duplicated across the OAuth-not-configured error
message, a docs page, and an agent prompt that could each drift.

**Outlook, and a personal Gmail route (#2594, "the Google half of #2590").**
``google_workspace`` (Internal consent screen, the account-kind interview)
and ``microsoft_work`` still earn their own PR — see #2594's remaining scope.
``ROUTES`` has two entries.

No ``resolve_route`` / interview function here — the provider alone selects
the route (``ROUTES[provider]``), because the only question that decides it
("Gmail or Outlook?") is already asked elsewhere
(``onboarding_tools._choose_provider``). A provider with no route must get a
defined, user-legible answer from ``get_route`` (``None``) — never a
``KeyError`` — so a caller can render "no guided walkthrough yet" instead of
crashing.

# it fails device code with ``AADSTS7000218`` ("client_secret is required"),
# a spectacularly confusing error for a route that has no secret. Naming it
# as its own step makes it a step GAIA can actually walk the user through
