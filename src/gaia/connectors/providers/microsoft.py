Microsoft identity platform (v2.0) OAuth provider for ``gaia.connectors``.

Foundation for the Outlook mailbox (#1275) and calendar (#1276) agents:
unlocks MS Graph (mail, calendar, OneDrive, Teams, SharePoint) for any agent
through the same generic ``oauth_pkce`` handler that already drives Google.

NO module-level side effects: instantiating the provider reads stored/env
credentials and computes ``client_id_hash``. Importing this module registers
nothing — registration is lazy on first ``get(<connector_id>)`` (see
``providers/__init__.py``), matching ``GoogleOAuthProvider``.

One CLASS, two connectors (#2628): ``microsoft`` (Personal, ``consumers``
authority) and ``microsoft_work`` (Work or School, ``organizations``
authority, optionally narrowed to a single Directory/tenant id) both
instantiate THIS class, dispatched via ``ConnectorSpec.oauth_impl`` in
``providers/__init__.py`` — never via a hard-coded id check here. Each
instance's identity (``provider_id``) drives EVERY per-connector concern:
which keyring slot it reads/writes (``store.peek_provider_credentials``),
which env vars are its fallback (``GAIA_{PROVIDER_ID}_CLIENT_ID`` /
``_CLIENT_SECRET``), which guided walkthrough it renders on a missing
client, and which OAuth authority it authenticates against. Two instances
with different ``provider_id``s never share state — that separation is the
entire point of the split (plan amendment A1: sharing it would silently
clobber one connector's credentials with the other's).

Tenant resolution (D6, plan amendment A16) is a three-tier chain owned
entirely by ``__init__``, exactly mirroring how ``client_id``/``client_secret``
already separate their tiers:
  1. Explicit ``tenant=`` kwarg (tests / library callers).
  2. Stored provider-credentials blob's ``tenant`` key — the optional
     Directory (tenant) ID a user pastes into ``microsoft_work``'s setup
     form (#2616).
  3. ``default_tenant=`` kwarg — the connector spec's own default
     (``ConnectorSpec.oauth_tenant``), passed by ``providers.get()``.

Public-client PKCE: per the Microsoft identity platform docs, public clients
(native/desktop, single-page apps) MUST NOT send a ``client_secret`` when
redeeming an authorization code. This is the key difference from Google, which
*requires* a secret even for installed apps. So the setup form asks only for a
Client ID; ``token_request_body`` / ``refresh_request_body`` omit the secret
unless one is explicitly configured (a confidential web-app edge case).

The shared ``flow.py`` requires a refresh token (Microsoft returns one only
when ``offline_access`` is requested) and decodes the account email from the
id_token (returned only when ``openid`` is requested). Both scopes are in
``default_scopes`` so a first connect succeeds without any flow.py change.
