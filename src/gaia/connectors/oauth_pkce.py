OAuthPkceHandler — ConnectorHandler implementation for ``type="oauth_pkce"``.

Wraps the existing flow.py / tokens.py / store.py primitives from #915
under the ``ConnectorHandler`` Protocol so the framework dispatcher can
route ``get_credential`` / ``configure`` / ``disconnect`` / ``test`` to
the right implementation without knowing OAuth internals.

Registration happens at module import via ``register_handler``; callers
only need to ``import gaia.connectors.oauth_pkce`` (done by catalog/__init__.py).

The grant check is NOT performed here — the dispatcher in handler.py does
it before calling any handler method.
