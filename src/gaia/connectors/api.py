Public coordination layer for ``gaia.connectors``.

Each public function here is a thin orchestration over the per-module
primitives:

- ``start_authorization`` / ``complete_authorization`` → ``flow.py``
- ``get_access_token`` / ``get_access_token_sync`` → ``tokens.py`` +
  per-agent grant check via ``grants.py``
- ``list_connections`` / ``get_connection`` / ``revoke_connection`` →
  ``store.py``
- ``grant_agent`` / ``revoke_agent_grant`` / ``list_agent_grants`` →
  ``grants.py``
- ``tripwire_check`` → ``store.load_connection`` for every known provider

This is the only file that combines tokens with grants — the per-module
primitives are deliberately decoupled.

    Each agent's scopes come from its ``REQUIRED_CONNECTORS`` declaration for
    ``connector_id`` — the single source of truth both the CLI
    (``gaia connectors connect --grant-agent``) and the Agent UI router's
    ``/authorize``, ``/authorize-device``, and ``/configure`` endpoints read,
    so the two surfaces cannot drift (#2117's original resolver, hoisted here
    out of ``gaia.ui.routers.connectors`` so it is FastAPI-free).

    ``registry`` is duck-typed — any object exposing ``.list()`` that returns
    entries with ``.namespaced_agent_id`` and ``.required_connections``
    (``AgentRegistry`` shaped). This module never imports ``gaia.agents``.

    Fails loudly (no silent skips or truncation):
      - an unknown agent id -> ``UnknownAgentError``;
      - an agent that declares no scopes for ``connector_id`` -> raises
        ``NoDeclaredScopesError`` rather than ever falling back to the
        provider's ``default_scopes``;
      - a declared scope outside ``REGISTRY.get(connector_id).available_scopes``
        -> ``ScopeNotAllowedError`` naming the offending scope(s). Without
        this ceiling, an agent's own declaration would flow straight into the
        OAuth consent screen with no check against the catalog (#2603 C4) —
        the registry already namespaces against a malicious custom agent
        claiming a built-in's identity, but not against bad scope values.
        Skipped (no ceiling enforced) only when ``connector_id`` itself is
        not in the connector catalog — an unrelated failure surfaces later
        at the connector lookup that every caller already performs.
