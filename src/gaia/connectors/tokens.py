"""
Per-provider access-token cache with double-checked locking and refresh.

Critical invariants (T-5b, plan amendments A6, A7):

- One ``asyncio.Lock`` per ``(provider, account_email)`` cache slot. The
  refresh path uses **explicit ``async with lock:`` (context-manager form)**
  so the lock is released on exception. Manual ``acquire``/``release``
  pairs are forbidden — they deadlock if a refresh raises.

- 60-second expiry buffer: a token whose ``expires_at`` is within the
  next 60 seconds is treated as already expired (AC4).

- Default ``expires_in = 3600`` if the token endpoint omits or returns
  zero (A6). Without this, the cache treats every token as immediately
  expired and refreshes on every call.

- Refresh-token rotation: if the token endpoint returns a new
  ``refresh_token`` in the response body, we persist it via
  ``store.save_connection``. The keyring's per-key atomic overwrite
  guarantees the new token is durably stored before we discard the old
  one in memory.

- One retry on ``401 invalid_token`` from the resource (clock skew).
  Bounded — no recursion, no loop, max 2 HTTP round-trips per call.
