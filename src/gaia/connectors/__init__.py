gaia.connectors — OAuth-bound external API access for any GAIA caller.

This package implements OAuth 2.0 PKCE for desktop apps (RFC 7636/8252) with
refresh tokens stored in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, Linux
SecretService) and per-agent grants in ``~/.gaia/connectors/grants.json``.

The module is **self-contained**: SDK, CLI, and AgentUI are equal callers.
Nothing about the OAuth flow, keyring storage, grants ledger, or token-fetch
path requires the AgentUI FastAPI server to be running. Any Python process
running as the user can drive the full flow.

Scope assumption: the in-memory token cache is process-local. Two GAIA
processes running concurrently (e.g. ``gaia chat --ui`` and ``gaia connectors
status``) each maintain their own cache and share the keyring; if both refresh
concurrently and the provider rotates the refresh token, one process may
observe ``invalid_grant`` and reconnect transparently. See
``docs/security/connections.mdx`` for the cross-process race discussion.

The internal modules (``tokens``, ``flow``, ``store``, ``grants``, ``pkce``,
``context``, ``events``) are NOT part of the public surface and may change
without notice. Only the names re-exported here are stable.
