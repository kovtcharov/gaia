.SYNOPSIS
    Ensure a healthy Lemonade server is running on $Port, persisting across CI jobs.

.DESCRIPTION
    GitHub Actions terminates any process a job spawns when the job ends, so a
    server started inline never survives to the next job. This launches
    LemonadeServer.exe with `--port $Port` (so it binds $Port regardless of a
    stale config.json) as a Windows **Scheduled Task** instead: the Task Scheduler
    owns it, not the job, so it persists across jobs and reboots. The task also
    auto-starts at boot.

    Idempotent + self-healing:
      - If a healthy server is already on $Port, returns immediately.
      - Otherwise (re)registers + starts the task, retrying until healthy, then
        warms $WarmModel (pull) so the first test request isn't a cold load.

    Use -ForceRestart to recycle the server even if it's currently healthy.

.PARAMETER Port           Server port (default 13305).
.PARAMETER ServerExe      Path to LemonadeServer.exe. Defaults to LEMONADE_SERVER_PATH.
.PARAMETER WarmModel      Model to pull so the backend is warm (default Gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF).
.PARAMETER ForceRestart   Restart the task even if the server is already healthy.
