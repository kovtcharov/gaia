; GAIA Terminal Hub — Windows setup.
;
; Built with STANDALONE makensis, not electron-builder. electron-builder is an
; Electron packager and the terminal hub is a pair of plain executables; routing
; through it would mean carrying an Electron app's assumptions (asar, an app
; bundle, a chrome-sandbox) for two files that need none of them. The
; conventions this repo already established for the Agent UI installer --
; per-user install, the pinned Lemonade MSI, "leave ~/.gaia alone unless asked"
; -- are followed here; see installer/nsis/installer.nsh for their original
; statement and rationale.
;
; Nothing is downloaded at INSTALL time -- the Lemonade MSI is bundled -- so the
; install itself works offline and behind a proxy. Lemonade's -minimal MSI is a
; bootstrap that fetches its runtime on first run, so running a model still
; needs the network once.
;
; Build:
;   makensis -DVERSION=0.23.0 \
;            -DPAYLOAD_DIR=<dir with gaia-tui.exe, gaia-agent.exe, LICENSE.md> \
;            -DLEMONADE_MSI=<path to lemonade-server-minimal.msi> \
;            -DLEMONADE_VERSION=11.5.0 \
;            -DICON=<path to gaia.ico> \
;            -DOUTFILE=gaia-0.23.0-win-x64-setup.exe \
