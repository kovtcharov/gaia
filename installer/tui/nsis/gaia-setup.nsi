; GAIA — the one Windows setup. The user picks the desktop app (Agent UI), the
; terminal (TUI), or both; at least one is required.
;
;   Desktop app  runs the embedded, unmodified electron-builder setup
;                (gaia-agent-ui-<v>-x64-setup.exe /S /currentuser). That setup
;                stays the app's owner -- its files, Installed-apps entry,
;                shortcuts, autostart and uninstaller -- because electron-updater
;                re-runs exactly that file to update the app. A second owner here
;                would be duplicated by the first auto-update.
;   Terminal     gaia-tui + gaia-agent, PATH, Windows Terminal profile, shortcuts,
;                under the "GAIA Terminal Hub" identity the TUI-only setup used,
;                so upgrading from it replaces it in place.
;
; No suite-level Installed-apps entry is written: each component is removed from
; its own entry, so nothing here can be left orphaned.
;
; Silent installs take /COMPONENTS=ui,tui (or ui, or tui). Without it, /S keeps
; what is already installed, and installs both on a fresh machine -- the same
; defaults the interactive page starts from.
;
; Built with STANDALONE makensis, not electron-builder. electron-builder is an
; Electron packager and the terminal hub is a pair of plain executables; routing
; through it would mean carrying an Electron app's assumptions (asar, an app
; bundle, a chrome-sandbox) for two files that need none of them. The
; conventions this repo already established for the Agent UI installer --
; per-user install, the pinned Lemonade MSI, "leave ~/.gaia alone unless asked"
; -- are followed here; see installer/nsis/installer.nsh for their original
; statement and rationale.
;
; Nothing is downloaded at INSTALL time -- the Lemonade MSI is bundled -- so the
; install itself works offline and behind a proxy. Lemonade's -minimal MSI is a
; bootstrap that fetches its runtime on first run, so running a model still
; needs the network once.
;
; Build:
;   makensis -DVERSION=<__version__ from src/gaia/version.py> \
;            -DPAYLOAD_DIR=<dir with gaia-tui.exe, gaia-agent.exe, LICENSE.md> \
