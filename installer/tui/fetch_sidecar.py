"""Download the flagship `gaia-agent` sidecar and verify it against the committed lock.

The terminal hub spawns `gaia-agent` as a child process, so an installer that
ships only the TUI installs a front end with nothing behind it.

Both the expected SHA-256 and the sidecar version come from the COMMITTED
``hub/agents/gaia/npm/binaries.lock.json``, never from the origin that served the
bytes -- an origin verifying itself is not an integrity check. Same contract as
``hub/agents/gaia/npm/src/fetch.ts``. The hub manifest is read only to resolve
the artifact's download path.

Two outcomes are deliberately distinct, and must stay so:

* a platform with NO entry in the lock exits ``EXIT_NO_SIDECAR_FOR_PLATFORM`` --
  the flagship publishes no sidecar there, so build no installer for it;
* an entry with a placeholder or corrupt digest is a hard stop (exit 1). There is
  no "use it anyway" path.

PLATFORM_KEYS translates the terminal hub's platform spelling (``win-x64``) to
the flagship's npm-style one (``win32-x64``).

Usage::

    python installer/tui/fetch_sidecar.py --platform win-x64 --out dist/payload
