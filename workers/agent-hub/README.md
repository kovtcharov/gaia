# GAIA Agent Hub — R2 distribution Worker

A Cloudflare Worker fronting an R2 bucket. It is the cloud distribution layer for
the [Agent Hub](https://amd-gaia.ai/docs/spec/agent-hub-restructure): publishers
upload an agent's `gaia-agent.yaml` + artifact (wheel or native binary), the
Worker validates and stores them immutably, generates a server-side checksum, and
rebuilds a lightweight catalog that the `gaia agent` CLI and the Hub UI read.

Implements [#1095](https://github.com/amd/gaia/issues/1095) (Phase 3A–3C of the
Agent Hub plan). This directory is **isolated infra** — it does not import or
depend on any `src/gaia` code.

## What it does

| Route | Auth | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `POST /publish` | Bearer | Publish a new agent version (validate → scope-check → immutability-check → checksum → store → rebuild index). Form parts: `manifest` (gaia-agent.yaml text), `artifact` (wheel/binary/zip file), optional `readme` + `changelog` + `spec` + `skill` + `evaluation` + `capability_matrix` + `eval_scorecard` (markdown, rendered as the Hub page's doc tabs), and optional `package_files` (JSON `{files:[{name,size_bytes}]}` listing the contents of a whole-package `.zip` artifact — surfaced as the catalog's `package`) |
| `POST /publish/skill` | Bearer | Publish a new **skill** version (#2467). Form parts: `skill` (the full `SKILL.md` — front matter + body), `artifact` (the packaged skill directory), optional `changelog`, optional `audit` (the security-audit report JSON, #2468) |
| `GET /index.json` | none | Catalog of every published package (latest version only), including the latest README + CHANGELOG + SPEC + SKILL + EVALUATION + CAPABILITY_MATRIX + scorecard markdown |
| `GET /agents/<id>/manifest.json` | none | Per-agent aggregate manifest (all versions) |
| `GET /agents/<id>/<version>/<file>` | none | Download an artifact, the raw `gaia-agent.yaml`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `SPEC.md`, `SKILL.md`, `EVALUATION.md`, `CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`, or `SCORECARD.md` |
| `GET /skills/<name>/manifest.json` | none | Per-skill aggregate manifest (all versions) |
| `GET /skills/<name>/<version>/<file>` | none | Download a skill bundle, its raw `SKILL.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or `audit.json` |
| `GET /health` | none | Liveness probe |

### Catalog lanes

`index.json` carries **one array** — `agents` — holding every lane, discriminated
by each entry's `type`: `agent` (default) · `app` · `component` (#1716) · `skill`
(#2467). The key keeps its historical name so every published consumer parses the
catalog unchanged; segmenting a lane is a filter, not a second document. **A
reader that renders every entry as an installable agent must filter on `type`** —
skills install through `gaia skill install`, not the agent install path.

Ids are one namespace across lanes: a skill may not shadow an agent id, and vice
versa (`409 id_conflict`).

### Publish guarantees

- **Per-publisher auth.** Bearer token resolved against the `PUBLISH_TOKENS`
  secret. Unknown/missing token → `401`. Missing secret → `500` (fails loudly;
  it never falls back to allow-all).
- **Publisher scope.** A token may only publish under the `author` values it is
  granted (`"*"` grants any). Once an agent id exists, only a publish whose
  `author` matches the recorded owner can add versions — you cannot hijack
  someone else's agent id.
- **Version immutability (per filename).** A published artifact is never
  overwritten: re-uploading the same `agents/<id>/<version>/<filename>` is
  rejected with `409`, enforced by an object-level `head()` check. A version's
  artifact set is **append-only per distinct filename** — see *Multi-platform
  releases* below. A `409` on an artifact that already matches is the idempotent
  re-run signal a release job treats as "already published".
- **Multi-platform releases.** A single `<id>@<version>` may hold more than one
  artifact — one per platform for a native binary (e.g. the frozen email agent
  ships four binaries under `email@0.1.0`). The first publish of a version
  creates it (and stores the immutable `gaia-agent.yaml`); each later publish
  under the same version with a *new* filename appends another artifact. The
  per-agent manifest's `versions[v]` records every artifact in `artifacts[]`,
  with `artifact` kept as the primary (first-published) entry for single-artifact
  (wheel) agents and catalog display.
- **Server-side SHA-256.** The checksum is computed by the Worker from the bytes
  it received — never trusted from the request. It is also handed to R2's `put`
  integrity check.
- **Automatic index rebuild.** After every successful publish, `index.json` is
  regenerated from all per-agent and per-skill manifests.
- **Security-audit gate (skills only).** `POST /publish/skill` refuses a skill
  claiming `community` or `verified` unless a cleared audit report rides along in
  the `audit` part; `BLOCK` is rejected (`403`), `REVIEW` is held (`409`), and an
  `experimental` skill published without a report is recorded honestly as
  `unaudited` rather than stamped `ALLOW`. Enforcement lives in
  [`src/audit.ts`](./src/audit.ts); the scanning engine that *produces* the
  verdict is `gaia skill audit`
  ([#2468](https://github.com/amd/gaia/issues/2468), `src/gaia/skills/audit/`)
  and runs publisher-side or in CI.
- **The report is bound to what it audited.** The claimed `security_tier` must
  appear in the report's `cleared_tiers`, and its `skill`, `version`, and
  `manifest_digest` must match the publish — otherwise an ALLOW earned as
  `experimental` for v1.0.0 could publish v1.1.0 as `verified`. Failures are
  `audit_tier_not_cleared` (403), `audit_skill_mismatch` (400), `audit_stale`
  (428), and `audit_digest_mismatch` (400). For a gated tier a *missing* binding
  field is refused too, or omitting it would be the bypass.
  <br />**These close replay and accident, not forgery.** The report is
  publisher-supplied and unsigned, so a hostile publisher can fabricate one whose
  every field agrees. The stored record therefore says
  `attestation: "publisher-asserted"` — read it as "self-consistent", never as
  "AMD vouches for this". An unforgeable verdict needs signing
  ([#1710](https://github.com/amd/gaia/issues/1710)) or the Worker running the
  audit itself. `content_digest` (the whole tree) is recorded but not recomputed
  here, because the tree arrives as an archive this Worker does not unpack.

## JSON shapes

Field names mirror `gaia-agent.yaml` (parsed by `src/gaia/hub/manifest.py`) so the
catalog is consumable by the same code that reads source manifests. Formal
schemas live in [`schemas/`](./schemas):

- [`schemas/index.schema.json`](./schemas/index.schema.json) — `GET /index.json`.
  Each entry: `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `latest_version`, `icon`,
  `language`, `author`, `security_tier`, `download_size_bytes`, `tags`,
  `tools_count`, `models`, `min_gaia_version`, `permissions`, `deprecated`,
  `deprecation_message` (only when set), full `requirements` (`min_memory_gb`,
  `min_disk_gb`, `min_context_size`, `platforms`, `npu` as
  `"required"`/`"optional"`, `gpu_vram_gb`), `readme` (latest version's README
  markdown, `""` if none was published), `changelog` (latest version's CHANGELOG
  markdown, `""` if none was published), `spec` + `skill` + `evaluation` +
  `capability_matrix` (latest version's SPEC.md / SKILL.md / EVALUATION.md /
  CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md markdown, `""` if none was published), `scorecard` (latest
  version's SCORECARD.md body with the YAML front matter stripped, `""` if none
  was published), the optional `eval_scorecard_url` + `eval_score` (the raw
  scorecard's public URL and its parsed 0–100 aggregate, absent when no scorecard
  was published), the optional `npm_package` /
  `playground_url` (present only when the manifest declares them — they drive the
  hub page's npm install method and playground launcher), and the optional
  `package` (`{ filename, size_bytes, files: [{name, size_bytes}] }` — the
  whole-package `.zip` download + its file listing, present only when a
  `package_files` manifest was published). This shape is the build-time contract
  for the website Hub pages (`website/src/data/catalog.ts`). It also carries
  `type` (the lane discriminator) and, on `type: "skill"` entries only,
  `skill_metadata` (`tools`, `tools_required`, the skill-shaped `requirements`,
  and the `audit` record). A skill entry populates every agent-lane key with a
  stable empty value (`requirements` zeroed, `tags`/`models` empty), so a
  consumer that reads them unconditionally never hits `undefined`; its `readme`
  carries the **SKILL.md body** (front matter stripped), which is a skill's
  primary doc.
- [`schemas/manifest.schema.json`](./schemas/manifest.schema.json) —
  `GET /agents/<id>/manifest.json`. Full display metadata plus a `versions` map;
  each version carries `published_at`, `publisher`, `deprecated`, an `artifact`
  block (the primary — `filename`, `path`, `size_bytes`, `sha256`,
  `content_type`), and an `artifacts[]` array of every per-platform artifact in
  that version. `GET /skills/<name>/manifest.json` uses the same `versions` shape
  with skill-lane display metadata (`security_tier`, `permissions`, `tools`,
  `tools_required`, `requirements`, `audit`) — install-time artifact verification
  reads `versions[v].artifact.sha256` from here, exactly as the agent lane does.

## Local development & testing

No real Cloudflare account or R2 bucket is needed for development.

```bash
npm install
npm test            # vitest — runs the full handlers against an in-memory R2 fake
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run dev         # wrangler dev — Miniflare's simulated R2, no real bucket
npm run deploy:dry-run   # validate wrangler.toml + bundle without deploying
```

`npm test` exercises the request handlers end-to-end (auth rejection, scope
enforcement, version immutability, checksum generation, index rebuild, download
routes) using `test/fake-r2.ts`, an in-memory R2 that implements the subset of
the `R2Bucket` API the Worker uses. The handlers rely only on Web-standard
globals (`Request`, `Response`, `FormData`, `crypto.subtle`), so the suite runs
in plain Node without Miniflare.

### Try a publish against `wrangler dev`

```bash
# Terminal 1
PUBLISH_TOKENS='{"dev-token":{"publisher":"AMD","authors":["AMD"]}}' npm run dev

# Terminal 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/publish \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-token" \
  -F "manifest=@hub/agents/chat/python/gaia-agent.yaml" \
  -F "artifact=@dist/gaia_agent_chat-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl" \
  -F "readme=@hub/agents/chat/python/README.md;type=text/markdown" \
  -F "changelog=@hub/agents/chat/python/CHANGELOG.md;type=text/markdown"

curl http://localhost:8787/index.json
```

## Deploying (maintainer)

Deploy requires Cloudflare resources the maintainer provisions — they are **not**
checked into the repo:

1. **Create the R2 bucket** named to match `bucket_name` in
   [`wrangler.toml`](./wrangler.toml) (default `gaia-agent-hub`):

   ```bash
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create gaia-agent-hub
   ```

2. **Set the publisher token map** as a secret (JSON of token → publisher):

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put PUBLISH_TOKENS
   # paste, e.g.:
   # {
   #   "<amd-token>":   { "publisher": "AMD",        "authors": ["AMD"] },
   #   "<indie-token>": { "publisher": "Jane Dev",   "authors": ["Jane Dev"] },
   #   "<admin-token>": { "publisher": "Hub Admin",  "authors": ["*"] }
   # }
   ```

   Tokens are tied to the AMD Developer Program. The `authors` list bounds which
   `author` values a token may publish under; `"*"` is reserved for hub admins.

3. **Deploy:**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

   CI does this for you on a real publish. `release_components.yml`'s
   `deploy-worker` job deploys this Worker before it uploads anything, because
   the Worker *validates* the manifests being uploaded — a Worker older than the
   manifests rejects a valid release. That is not hypothetical: `go` and
   `typescript` were added to `VALID_LANGUAGES` and the Worker was not
   redeployed, so every publish failed with `language "go" is not supported`
   while the source said otherwise.

   The job needs two secrets on the **`worker-deploy`** environment — a second
   environment with no required reviewers (so a release still prompts once)
   but the same deployment ref allowlist as `agent-publish`:

   | Secret | How to get it |
   |---|---|
   | `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → **Edit Cloudflare Workers** template. Must also cover R2 for the bucket binding. |
   | `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → Account ID |

   Without them the job fails loudly rather than publishing to a stale Worker.

   **Creating the environment** (Settings → Environments → New environment,
   named `worker-deploy`). Both settings below are load-bearing, and the second
   one is easy to miss:

   | Setting | Value | Why |
   |---|---|---|
   | Required reviewers | *leave empty* | The publish jobs are already gated on `agent-publish`. A reviewer here would add a second approval prompt to every release, which is the thing this environment exists to avoid. |
   | Deployment branches and tags | `main`, `v*`, `agent-pkg-*` — the same allowlist as `agent-publish` | This is the *only* remaining restriction on the job. Without it, anyone with write access can dispatch the workflow from an arbitrary branch with `dry_run` unchecked and push that branch's Worker to production — and the Worker is the manifest validator that holds the R2 binding. |

   The deploy stamps the commit into `WORKER_BUILD`, which `GET /health`
   returns, so the workflow can assert *which* build went live instead of
   assuming. Check it by hand any time:

   ```bash
   curl -s https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/health
   # {"status":"ok","build":"<commit>"}   — "unknown" means a hand-run deploy
   ```

4. **(Optional) Bind the route** by uncommenting the `routes` line in
   `wrangler.toml` to serve the API under `hub.amd-gaia.ai/*`.

`MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES` (a plain var, default 250 MiB) caps artifact size and can be
overridden per environment without a secret.

### Publishing origins (one Worker, two doors)

There is exactly **one Agent Hub Worker and one R2 bucket** — `hub.amd-gaia.ai`
and the `workers.dev` URL are two front doors onto the same Worker
(`workers/agent-hub/wrangler.toml`): the custom domain is the user-facing
download door, and the `workers.dev` origin is the CI upload door. The managed
WAF fronting the custom domain **403s large uploads** (the `POST /publish`
path), so CI publishes through the `workers.dev` origin, which has no such
ruleset and hits the same Worker + bucket. A publish through the wrong door
fails loudly at the WAF — it does not land somewhere else.

CI uses two repository variables (set at **repository** level, not environment
level — the version jobs have no `environment:` and an environment-scoped
variable would resolve empty and silently fall back to the hardcode):

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GAIA_HUB_BASE_URL` | `https://hub.amd-gaia.ai` | Downloads + the lock `baseUrl` (GETs aren't WAF-blocked) |
| `GAIA_HUB_PUBLISH_URL` | `<worker>.workers.dev` | The origin CI POSTs uploads to. **Required** — the release fails loudly if unset (no silent fallback to a hardcoded URL) |

The publish jobs (`release_agent_*.yml`, `release_components.yml`) now assert
`GAIA_HUB_PUBLISH_URL` is set before publishing, mirroring the existing
`GAIA_HUB_TOKEN` asserts. A missing variable is a startup-time `::error::`
naming what is missing and where to set it, not a 403 halfway through a
release.

## Publishing artifacts larger than 100 MB

A Worker request body is capped by the Cloudflare **account plan** — 100 MB on
Free and Pro, 200 MB Business, 500 MB Enterprise. `POST /publish` therefore
cannot carry the Agent UI installers (106-135 MiB); they are rejected with a
`413` by Cloudflare's edge before the Worker executes, so `MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES`
is not involved and raising it changes nothing.

Artifacts at or above 90 MiB are instead PUT straight into the bucket over R2's
S3 API and published **by reference**: the POST carries
`artifact_ref_{filename,sha256,size,content_type}` in place of the file part.

Integrity is not relaxed. Before recording anything the Worker heads the object
and checks its size and SHA-256 against what R2 stored at PUT time. R2 keeps a
whole-object SHA-256 only for **single-part** uploads, so an object without one
is refused (`artifact_unverifiable`) rather than accepted on the publisher's
word — the uploader must use `put_object` with `ChecksumSHA256`, never
`upload_file`, which switches to multipart and drops the checksum.

The publisher needs three extra secrets for this path:

| Secret | How to get it |
|---|---|
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Cloudflare dashboard → R2 → **Manage API Tokens** → create a token with **Object Read & Write** on the hub bucket |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Shown once alongside the access key id |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Same value the Worker deploy uses |

These are R2 S3 credentials and are **not** the same as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`,
which deploys the Worker. Missing any of them is a loud failure naming all
three; the publisher never silently falls back to the Worker path, because that
path 413s and would waste the release.

## Deploying on Railway (demo)

For demo/staging only: [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) runs `wrangler dev`
(Miniflare) with simulated R2 persisted to a Railway volume — no Cloudflare
account needed. Railway service settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Root directory | `workers/agent-hub` |
| Env var | `PUBLISH_TOKENS` — JSON token map (same shape as the production secret above). The container fails at startup if unset. |
| Volume | mount at `/data` (simulated R2 state lives in `/data/wrangler-state`) |
| Healthcheck | `/health` (set via [`railway.json`](./railway.json)) |

Railway injects `PORT` automatically; the container listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`.
