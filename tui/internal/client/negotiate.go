// Contract-version negotiation for optional request fields.
//
// The two halves of a feature reach users on different clocks: a TUI change
// ships the moment the TUI builds, while a sidecar change only lands when a new
// agent binary is PUBLISHED and the user installs it. So a freshly built TUI
// routinely talks to an older sidecar than the source tree it was built from.
//
// Sidecar request models are strict (`extra="forbid"`), which is correct — an
// unknown field is a loud 422, not a silently ignored one. That makes sending a
// field the peer never agreed to a hard failure of EVERY request, not a
// degraded one. So the client asks first: `GET /v1/<agent>/version` reports the
// peer's contract version, and an optional field is only sent when the peer is
// new enough to accept it.
//
// Absent the capability the client does not claim it. That is negotiation, not
// a silent fallback: the capability genuinely is not there, and the honest thing
// is to say so — which `noticeForMissingCapability` does, once, where the user
// can read it.

// questionsContract is the contract version that introduced `needs_input` plus
// `POST /query/{run_id}/respond` (#2469). A peer below it 422s the
// `can_answer_questions` field, so it is omitted entirely.

// worklist (#2743, schema 2.11). A peer below it omits needs_you/bulk from
// its /prescan response entirely -- decoded as a zero-value empty slice,
// which reads as a confident "nothing needs you" indistinguishable from a
// genuinely clear inbox. FetchPreScan gates on this before trusting the
// field at all.

// no memory route at all.
