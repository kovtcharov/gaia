// AgentResponder is implemented by transports that can answer a mid-run

// ORIGINAL stream. Send() would start a new turn instead — the answer has to go
// out of band, which is the whole point of the resume seam.
//
// A transport that cannot do this simply does not implement it, and the UI says
// so instead of silently swallowing the answer.

// Distinct from Send, which starts a new turn and is refused while one is in
// flight (the sidecar serialises turns per session on a run_lock), and from
// AgentResponder, which answers a question the run is parked on. This one
// interrupts nothing: the agent folds the text into the turn already running at
// its next agent-loop step boundary, so a second thought during a five-minute
// turn is answered in that turn instead of waiting it out.
//
// A transport that cannot do this simply does not implement it, and the UI
// holds the message locally until the turn ends — today's behaviour — rather
// than pretending it was delivered.
type FollowUpSender interface {
	// SendFollowUp delivers text to whatever run is currently streaming. It
	// returns an actionable error if there is no live run to take it, or the
	// request could not be delivered; the caller must then hold the message
	// rather than drop it.

// AgentCanceler is implemented by transports where the server, not this
// client dropping its connection, decides when a cancelled run has actually
// settled (#2901) — e.g. a daemon-relay session guarded by a server-side
// lock that a worker thread releases on its own cooperative schedule.
//
// Cancel asks the server to stop the active run out of band. It deliberately
// does NOT tear down the caller's own read of the run's event channel: that
// read has to keep going until the channel closes on its own, because THAT
// closure — not this call returning — is the one signal proven to follow the
// server's cleanup.
//
// The local subprocess implements it too: killing the child would discard the
// session state it holds, so Cancel asks it to stop and the caller's own
// context.CancelFunc stays the escalation that kills it.
type AgentCanceler interface {

// AgentConfirmer is implemented by transports that can resolve a
// needs_confirmation pause under the resume model (spec §5: the event carries
// a non-empty confirm_url and the run stays paused server-side awaiting it).
//
// No shipped sidecar sets confirm_url today — every current agent speaks the
// stateless stop-and-hand-off model, where needs_confirmation is immediately
// terminal and there is nothing to resume. A transport still implements this
// so a future resume-model peer is not left unreachable by the client; the UI
// only calls it when the triggering event actually carried a confirm_url.
type AgentConfirmer interface {
	// Confirm delivers the user's decision for runID's pending confirmation.

// ToolPermissionResponder is implemented by transports that can answer a

//
// Distinct from AgentConfirmer, which resolves an already-finished run's
// recorded pause out of band. This one is the live seam: the agent thread is
// blocked inside confirm_tool_execution and resumes the moment the decision
// lands. A transport that cannot do this leaves the modal a record of intent —
// which is what produced the original defect, where every gated tool
// auto-denied because the answer had nowhere to go.

// LivePermissionReporter is implemented by a transport whose ability to answer

//
// A daemon-relayed transport only learns the peer's contract from an async
// probe (negotiate.go), which the UI cannot wait on from a synchronous,
// per-keystroke call site (paletteFiltered, syncPalette). known == false
// means "the probe hasn't resolved" -- callers must treat that as "do not
// hide the command yet", never as "unsupported", or a command flickers away
// on every keystroke until the probe lands.
