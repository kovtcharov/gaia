// The local runner: readiness for an agent the TUI spawns itself.
//
// The flagship is a child process — TUI → agent → Lemonade — with no daemon, no
// HTTP port, no bearer token and no model-slot lease in the path. So none of
// the daemon runner's probes apply: there is no relay to ask, and asking would
// answer "not installed" for a launch that works. That is exactly why this
// launch used to have NO gate at all.
//
// Three rows, each probed directly on this machine for a local session, plus
// the Claude credential row when --use-claude is active:
//
//	GAIA agent  is the program on disk?      catalog.Find
//	Claude      is the Anthropic credential set?  process environment
//	Local AI    is the model server up?      one GET on loopback
//	AI model    are the models downloaded?   gaia init --check
//
// Every remedy is the daemon runner's, verbatim where one exists —
// lemonadeStartRemedy in particular is host-local, has no daemon dependency,
// and resolves the launcher against THIS machine rather than a GOOS table. Two
// screens that answer "Lemonade is down" with two different commands is the
// drift this reuse exists to prevent.

// is serving. A healthy server answers in milliseconds; past this it is not
// answering rather than answering slowly.
