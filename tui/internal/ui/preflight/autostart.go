// Starting an installed-but-stopped Lemonade, instead of asking the user to.
//
// The readiness screen used to stop dead on "Lemonade not running" and wait for
// a keypress, on a machine where it had already resolved the exact command that
// would fix it. For the commonest case — installed, just not running — that is a
// prompt to do something the program can do itself, and it is the screen users
// hit most often.
//
// The line this does NOT cross is installing. Nothing is downloaded here: a
// first run still pulls gigabytes of server and weights, and that needs a human
// to agree. So an installed server is started automatically; an absent one keeps
// the `f` key it always had.
//
// It is also not a silent retry. A start that fails reports what was run and
// what came back, and the row goes red exactly as before — the user is never
// left looking at a screen that quietly tried and gave up.
