// Package preflight is the TUI's readiness gate: the screen that tells a user
// why an agent cannot start and what to press to fix it.
//
// It answers four generic preconditions — the daemon is up and speaks our
// contract, the agent's sidecar is running, the local model server is reachable
// at a compatible version, and the model is downloaded — plus any number of
// per-agent extra checks (for email: a mailbox that is connected, granted send,
// AND proven readable). Every answer is machine-readable already; this package
// turns those answers into one row per precondition with a state, a human line,
// and a remedy that names a real command.
//
// Three rules the rest of the package exists to enforce:
//
//   - `unknown` is not `ok`. GET /v1/<agent>/init reports `compatible: null`
//     when Lemonade does not advertise a version. That is an indeterminate
//     check, not a pass, and it renders as its own state.
//   - No raw HTTP status ever reaches the user. Ladder maps a failed call to
//     {cause, remedy, where-to-look}, specific causes before generic ones.
//   - `configured` is not `working`. A row that can only read a service's own
//     record of itself has not verified anything the user will feel. Where the
//     record can disagree with reality — a stored OAuth connection reports
//     `connected: true` long after its credentials stop working — the row makes
//     the smallest real call instead, and reports `unknown` when even that
//     cannot answer. See MailboxCheck.
//
// # What an indeterminate row does, and why that is not the gate going soft
//
// Three separate questions get three separate answers, and conflating them is
// what makes a gate either dishonest or useless:
//
//   - Is it proven ready?   Report.Ready() — false for an unknown row, always.
//   - Is it proven broken?  A failed row — including an optional one.
//   - Does the launch stop? Report.Blocked() for a failed row the AGENT needs
//     (StateFailed and not Optional); for an unknown row, its Disposition.
//
// So an unknown row renders `[?]` and keeps Ready() false either way. Most of
// them — an unadvertised Lemonade version, two mailboxes linked so neither
// can be probed — are Disposition Notify: named on screen while the agent
// starts, launch not stopped. The alternative — demanding a keypress every
// time — was rejected deliberately for these: the condition is one the user
// cannot fix (their Lemonade build simply does not report a version), so the
// prompt would fire on every single launch forever. A prompt that always
// fires and never means anything is dismissed reflexively, and it devalues
// every other prompt in the product. The signal is kept; the ritual is not.
//
// A handful of unknown rows are Disposition Halt instead — a model loaded
// into a context window smaller than the profile pins, where a document-sized
// request comes back context_length_exceeded. Unlike the Notify cases, this
// one is consequential and not something re-checking clears on its own, so it
// holds for a person rather than proceeding silently. See internal/ui/status
// for how a Halt row reaches the rest of the app.
//
// A row that is genuinely broken (StateFailed) still blocks via Report.Blocked
// unless it is one the agent itself can repair once the conversation starts
// (Report.OfferableDespiteFailure) — that one keystroke opens the door to the
// repair instead of a second gate in front of it.
