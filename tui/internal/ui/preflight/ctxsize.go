// Why a start command has to carry the context window.
//
// A bare `lemond` comes up HEALTHY — /api/v1/health answers 200 — and small
// requests even succeed, so nothing looks wrong until a real one arrives. On a
// 10.10.0 machine, across repeated runs, the model loaded at 25037-37888 tokens
// started bare and 32527-43227 with the profile's 65536 requested. A 40k-token
// request came back `context_length_exceeded` against the low end of both.
//
// That is the worst shape this package exists to prevent: the Local AI row goes
// green off the healthy server, hands the user into chat, and the first real
// request fails. A remedy that produces it is a wrong remedy, not merely an
// incomplete one.
//
// Two things those ranges say, and both are load-bearing:
//
//   - Asking for the window RAISES it. Every paired measurement put the
//     requested run above the bare one, so the prefix earns its place.
//   - It does not GUARANTEE it. The figure moved run to run and none of those
//     runs reached 65536, because llama.cpp clamps to the memory actually free at
//     load time. That is a load-moment effect, NOT a ceiling: other loads on the
//     same machine the same day did reach 65536, five of them. So nothing here
//     promises the target, and nothing here blames the hardware — the AI model
//     row reports the window the server really loaded, and says so when it falls
//     short (see markCtxShortfall).
//
// The value is DERIVED, never hardcoded. GAIA pins one context window per device
// profile (lemonade_client.GPU_CTX_SIZE / NPU_CTX_SIZE) and `gaia init` records
// which profile this machine runs in ~/.gaia/config.json as `default_device`.
// Reading that file is how the TUI stays consistent with the Python without
// depending on the `gaia` CLI being on PATH.

// Context windows per device profile. These MUST equal
// gaia.llm.lemonade_client.GPU_CTX_SIZE / NPU_CTX_SIZE: the NPU's FastFlowLM
// build is registered at 32768 and cannot reach 65536, so handing it the GPU
// window fails the load outright — and collapsing them to one number would cap
// GPU doc-Q&A at 32K and re-open the #1030 context overflow.
