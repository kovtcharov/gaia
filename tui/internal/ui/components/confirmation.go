// the calendar RSVP actions are Write — external or state-changing, but not
// destructive on their own terms. permanent_delete and quarantine are
// Destructive: one is irreversible by name, the other pulls a message out of
// the inbox on the agent's own judgment about a security threat, where a false
// positive hides real mail.
//
// The second group is the base set every agent gates
// (agent.TOOLS_REQUIRING_CONFIRMATION in src/gaia/agents/base/agent.py) plus
// the flagship's own two. Left unlisted they all fell through to the cautious
// default and rendered "DESTRUCTIVE" — including a `pwd`. A badge that says
// DESTRUCTIVE for everything says nothing, and crying wolf on the safe calls
// is what makes the loud one ignorable.
//
// The shell tools stay Destructive because their name genuinely does not bound
// what they do: `run_shell_command` is `pwd` on one call and `rm -rf` on the
// next. The file writers are Write — scoped, and visible afterwards.
