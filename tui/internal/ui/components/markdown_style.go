// gaiaStyle derives GAIA's markdown look from a glamour builtin.
//
// Glamour's stock dark style renders an agent answer as one flat wash of grey
// 252: headings barely separate from body text, list bullets are the same
// colour as the words after them, tables have no rules at all, and `strong` is
// bold-only, which most terminal fonts render as a barely-visible weight shift.
// An answer that is mostly prose therefore arrives looking like a log line — the
// thing the user actually asked for, styled less than the status bar above it.
//
// So the overrides below are structural rather than decorative: they give the
// eye something to land on when scanning an answer — headings, bullets, table
// rules, code, links, emphasis.
