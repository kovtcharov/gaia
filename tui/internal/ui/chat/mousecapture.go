// Who owns the mouse, and why — the terminal by default (see teaOptions in
// ui/app.go), the app only for as long as it genuinely needs clicks.
//
// There are two independent reasons the app might want the mouse:
//
//  1. mouseWheelOn: the user asked for it, via Ctrl+T (selectmode.go) — wheel
//     scrolling instead of drag-select, until they ask again.
//  2. An interactive overlay is open (the "/" palette, a mid-run question)
//     and needs clicks — see overlayOpen. This one is never a user choice: it
//     is scoped to exactly the frames the overlay is on screen, and releases
//     itself the moment it closes.
//
// mouseCaptured (selectmode.go) is the actual, reconciled state — whichever
// of the two (or both) currently wants the mouse. Deriving it fresh on every
// Update (applyMouseCapture, called from the top-level Update wrapper) rather
// than letting each caller flip it directly is what makes the two reasons
// composable: an overlay opening while wheel mode is already on must not
// re-issue a redundant escape sequence, and an overlay closing while wheel
// mode is on must leave the mouse captured rather than yanking it back to the
// terminal out from under a user who never asked for that.
//
// overlayOpen also decides whether motion (hover, no button held) is worth
// asking the terminal for: an overlay needs it (clicking the row you are
// already hovering is what "click" means once hover works at all), plain
// wheel mode does not, and All-Motion tracking is noticeably chattier over
// SSH than Cell-Motion — see applyMouseCapture.

// applyMouseCapture reconciles m.mouseCaptured (and which motion mode it is
// in) with what is currently wanted, returning the tea.Cmd that changes the
// terminal's mouse mode — or nil when nothing changed. Called once per
// Update, from the top-level ChatModel.Update wrapper, so every path that can
// open or close an overlay (a keystroke, a canonical needs_input/
// needs_confirmation event, the turn settling) is covered from one place
// rather than requiring every such call site to remember to reconcile it.
