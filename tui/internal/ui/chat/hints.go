// Truncating the string is the wrong answer even though it is the easy one.
// The hint reads left to right in the order the items were concatenated, so a
// right-hand cut always eats the LAST item; "↑↓ scroll · Ctrl+C quit" at 20
// columns becomes "↑↓ scroll · Ctrl+C…", which drops the escape hatch and keeps
// the nice-to-have. On a narrow window that is exactly backwards: the smaller
// the screen, the more the user needs the way out and the less they need to be
// told the wheel scrolls.

// the rest fit. Every item is either fully readable or absent — never a word
// ending in an ellipsis.
