// OSC 52 asks the TERMINAL to set the clipboard, which is what makes this work
// unchanged over SSH — no cgo, no X11 socket, no pbcopy/xclip/wl-copy to shell
// out to and no platform matrix to keep alive. The cost is that support is not
// universal and, by design, nothing reports back: the escape is write-only, so
// a terminal that ignores it does so silently. Hence copyHint below, which
// promises only what was attempted.
//
// Known non-support at time of writing: Windows Console Host (conhost) and the
// older mintty builds. Windows Terminal, iTerm2, kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty,
// foot and tmux (with set-clipboard on) all handle it.
