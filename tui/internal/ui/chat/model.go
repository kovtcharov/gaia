// cancelFn (the caller's own context.CancelFunc) tears down THIS client's
// read of the SSE stream, and that local abort is what closed the channel —
// well before the daemon's session run_lock was actually released by the
// sidecar's worker thread, which notices a cancel only cooperatively, at the
// next agent-loop step boundary (see
// hub/agents/email/python/gaia_agent_email/query_routes.py). Calling
// cancelFn() here reproduced the exact race it was meant to close: 5/5
// cancel-then-resend attempts still hit a bare-lock 409 downstream.
//
// The fix is to stop manufacturing that local "done" at all. For a transport
// that implements client.AgentCanceler (the daemon relay), Cancel() asks the
// SERVER to stop the run out of band, while THIS call leaves m.cancelFn /
// m.events untouched — the existing read keeps running, so it can observe
// whatever terminal signal the turn actually produces. In practice that is
// almost always the turn's own CanonicalFinalEvent/CanonicalErrorEvent, NOT
// the channel closing: the server's cooperative cancel just returns an
// ordinary "stopped" answer over the still-open stream, and those handlers
// stop rescheduling waitForEvent the moment they fire, so doneMsg can never
// arrive for them (see settleTurn's doc comment). doneMsg only settles a
// transport where the channel closing IS the terminal signal. Either way,
// settleTurn() is the single place that clears cancelPending once the turn's
// OWN signal — not this call — says it is over.
//
// A transport with no such server-side lock (e.g. a local subprocess) does
