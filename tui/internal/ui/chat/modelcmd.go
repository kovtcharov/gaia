// `/model` and `/model <id>` — live model switching. Unlike /full-access this
// command genuinely needs the AGENT: only it can discover which local
// Lemonade models are downloaded and validate a Claude id against a live
// credential. So it is recognized here (so the composer never treats it as a
// question typed at the LLM) but still dispatched over the query channel —
// see gaia_agent.stdio.run_model_command for why that channel, not the
// fire-and-forget control one /full-access uses, is the only one this transport
// can reliably carry a response back on.

// modelSwitchAgentID is the only agent whose transport understands `/model`
// today — the flagship's stdio.py intercepts it before it ever reaches the
// LLM (run_model_command). Every other agent (a daemon-relay agent like
// email, or another subprocess agent) has no such interception, so sending it
// the literal text would ship as an uncomprehended chat question — mirrors
// the existing preScanAgentID scoping (model.go) for the same reason: the
// feature lives agent-side, not transport-side, so it has to be gated by
// WHICH agent, not by what kind of connection this is.

// problem — a switch turn against a wedged or Claude-only session can sit
