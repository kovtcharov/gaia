// Bypass-permissions mode: the agent runs every confirmation-gated tool —
// shell commands, file writes — without asking.
//
// Three rules shape the whole implementation:
//
//  1. OFF on a fresh launch, always. It is the zero value of a bool, restored
//     from nothing, so there is no path that turns it on without someone asking
//     for it on this launch.
//  2. Turning it ON is deliberate: /bypass states what it means and does NOT
//     enable anything; a second, explicit /bypass confirm does. Turning it OFF
//     is one command and never gated — the safe direction is never slowed down.
//  3. While it is on, the UI says so on every single frame, in a band that
//     cannot be scrolled away. A line in scrollback does not qualify: scrollback
//     scrolls, and the whole requirement is that the user always knows the agent
//     is acting without them.
