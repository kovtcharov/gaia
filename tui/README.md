# GAIA Terminal Hub

Browse, install, and chat with GAIA agents without leaving the terminal.

GAIA agents do real work for you — triage your inbox, answer questions about
your files, write code. The terminal hub is how you find them, install them,
and talk to them. Everything runs on your own machine: no account, and nothing
you type is sent to a hosted service.

## Install

One command installs the `gaia` CLI, the local model runtime, and the terminal
hub itself:

```bash
# macOS and Linux
curl -fsSL https://amd-gaia.ai/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows
irm https://amd-gaia.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then set up the local model — several GB, so give it a while — and open the hub:

```bash
gaia init
gaia-tui
```

`gaia init` installs Lemonade Server, the runtime that does the thinking on your
machine. Skip it and the hub stops you before an agent starts and tells you the
same thing.

### Or download the binary directly

The installer fetches these and verifies their SHA-256; you can also take one
yourself. Rename it to `gaia-tui` and put it on your `PATH`:

| Platform | Download |
|---|---|
| Windows x64 | [`gaia-win-x64.exe`](https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/terminal-hub/0.23.0/gaia-win-x64.exe) |
| Windows ARM64 | [`gaia-win-arm64.exe`](https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/terminal-hub/0.23.0/gaia-win-arm64.exe) |
| macOS Apple Silicon | [`gaia-darwin-arm64`](https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/terminal-hub/0.23.0/gaia-darwin-arm64) |
| macOS Intel | [`gaia-darwin-x64`](https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/terminal-hub/0.23.0/gaia-darwin-x64) |
| Linux x64 | [`gaia-linux-x64`](https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/terminal-hub/0.23.0/gaia-linux-x64) |
| Linux ARM64 | [`gaia-linux-arm64`](https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/terminal-hub/0.23.0/gaia-linux-arm64) |

`https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/terminal-hub/manifest.json` lists what is
published, with the SHA-256 of each build. A direct download still needs the
`gaia` CLI on your `PATH` — the hub starts a local daemon through it — so the
one-line installer above is the shorter route.

The binary is installed as `gaia-tui`, never as `gaia`: the two have different
subcommands and would collide on your `PATH`.

### Building from source

For working on the hub itself. Needs `git`, [Go](https://go.dev/dl/), and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amd/gaia.git
cd gaia && uv venv && uv pip install -e .
cd tui && make build                # -> tui/bin/gaia
cp bin/gaia ~/.local/bin/gaia-tui   # somewhere on your PATH
```

## Your first run

```bash
gaia-tui
```

That opens the hub — a list of agents, what each one does, and whether you have
it. Pick one and it walks you through installing it, then drops you into a chat
with it.

Before an agent starts, the hub checks the few things that would otherwise make
it fail — is the model server running, is the model downloaded, does the agent
have what it needs. Anything not ready is shown with the exact command that
fixes it, so a failed check is a to-do list rather than a dead end.

Colours adapt to your terminal automatically. Some terminals never answer that
query (SSH, tmux, a CI log) — if the hub comes out hard to read, force it:

```bash
GAIA_TUI_THEME=light gaia-tui    # or dark; unset or "auto" = detect
```

## Commands worth knowing

```bash
gaia-tui                                     # open the hub
gaia-tui list                                # what the hub offers, and what you have
gaia-tui list --installed                    # local only, works offline
gaia-tui install email --trust               # install an agent
gaia-tui run email                           # chat with it
gaia-tui run email --query "triage my inbox" # one-shot: answer on stdout
gaia-tui uninstall email                     # remove it
gaia-tui status                              # is everything running, and what do I have
gaia-tui version
```

`--trust` on `install` is not a formality: an agent GAIA has not verified runs
third-party code on your machine, so the hub refuses until you say so.

# Going deeper

For developers and power users. If you just want to use GAIA agents, you are
already done.

## Exit codes

`gaia-tui run --query` is built to be scripted:

- `0` — the agent answered and nothing reported a failure
- `1` — an error, or a tool failed and nothing recovered it. This holds even
  when the agent still wrote an answer, so `gaia-tui run … && next-step` never
  fires over work that did not actually happen.
- `3` — a confirmation gate held back a destructive action this run had no way
  to approve: nothing broke, and nothing was done

`--timeout` bounds a single `--query` turn (default 15m).

In the pre-run checks, a condition that cannot be determined renders `[?]`
rather than a checkmark and never counts as ready — unknown is never treated as
fine.

## Testing the harness against Claude

`--use-claude` runs an agent on Anthropic's Claude API instead of the local
model. It exists so that when something goes wrong you can tell *which* thing
went wrong: on a known-good model, a bad answer is the harness's fault, not the
model's.

```bash
gaia-tui run gaia --query "..." --use-claude
gaia-tui run gaia --use-claude --claude-model claude-haiku-4-5
```

**This sends your conversation off the machine**, which is the one thing GAIA
otherwise never does — so the chat header names the exact model in use
(`claude · haiku-4.5`) for as long as the mode is on, colored to mark it
remote, and the launch says so in the transcript. It needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
set (a repo-root `.env` works too).

`--claude-model` takes one of `claude-opus-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`,
`claude-haiku-4-5`, `claude-fable-5` — there is no date suffix. Anything else
is refused at the command line, with the accepted ids, rather than forwarded to
Anthropic to come back a 404 mid-turn.

**A Claude session does not start the local backend at all.** First-boot setup
is skipped, so `LemonadeServer.exe` is never launched and the first answer is
not held behind an install. The transcript says so, and says what it costs:
retrieval, memory and the code index still embed through Lemonade (Anthropic
has no embeddings API), so those need `gaia init --profile chat
--skip-chat-model`, or `/setup` in the composer, before they work.

Paths that cannot honour the flag say so instead of quietly ignoring it: the
daemon transport refuses it, `--claude-model` without `--use-claude` refuses,
and `chat --subprocess` tells you to put the flag in the command line you own.

**Switching models mid-session:** the gaia agent also takes `/model` in the
chat composer — `/model` alone lists every switchable id (the curated Claude
5 family, plus whatever Lemonade currently has downloaded), and `/model <id>`
swaps the live client without losing conversation history or loaded skills.
Typing the space in `/model ` turns the slash palette into a model picker, so
the Claude ids are pickable rather than remembered; local ids stay behind bare
`/model`, since only the agent knows what this machine has downloaded.

An unknown id, a missing credential, or an unreachable Lemonade Server all
refuse the switch with an actionable message and leave the session on
whichever model was already working. Backends never swap themselves: a local
switch with Lemonade down is refused with both ways forward (start the server,
or name a Claude id), never silently answered somewhere else.

## Running against a local clone

Three independent layers, and only one of them has a flag.

**The hub binary** — just rebuild it: `cd tui && go build -o bin/gaia ./cmd/gaia`.

**GAIA core / the daemon** — no flag exists. The daemon serves whichever
checkout launched it, so you point it at your clone by launching it from an
editable install (`uv pip install -e .`) or with `PYTHONPATH=<clone>/src`, then
re-anchoring it:

```bash
gaia daemon stop && gaia daemon start
gaia daemon status    # "api: v1.1" is repo source; "v1" is the released wheel
```

The footgun: a per-user daemon keeps serving the checkout that launched it no
matter which directory you run the CLI from. If your edits do not seem to take,
that is almost always why.

**An agent from source** — `--mode user` (the default) runs the published frozen
binary; `--mode dev` runs it from a checkout:

```bash
gaia daemon start-agent email --mode dev [--dev-src-dir <path>]
```

Dev mode resolves your shell's own checkout (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
and compares it — never executes it — against the checkout the daemon is
anchored to; a mismatch is refused loudly, naming both checkouts and the fix.
`--dev-src-dir` is the explicit escape hatch, and wants the agent's package
directory (`<clone>/hub/agents/email/python`), not the repo root.

## An agent that only exists in your clone

**It shows up in the list.** The hub reads `~/.gaia/agents/<id>/.installed`
sentinel files and adds an id it has never seen rather than ignoring it, with
sparse metadata — a sentinel only proves id and version:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gaia/agents/myagent
echo '{"id":"myagent","version":"0.1.0"}' > ~/.gaia/agents/myagent/.installed
gaia-tui list --installed     # myagent  0.1.0  installed
```

**It will not run through the daemon.** Sidecar specs are built into GAIA core
and there is deliberately no runtime registration route, so `gaia daemon
start-agent myagent` fails with `unknown agent 'myagent'; registered agents:
email`. `--mode dev` develops an agent core already knows about; it does not add
a new one. Getting a brand-new agent supervised end to end is not documented yet.

## A daemon of your own

The daemon keys off `$HOME/.gaia/host/instance.json`, so a throwaway `HOME`
gets you a private daemon — own port, own agents, own state — that cannot
collide with your normal setup or a colleague's session on the same box. Set it
per command; an exported `HOME` outlives the command that needed it and quietly
redirects everything else you run in that shell.

```bash
TMPHOME=$(mktemp -d)
HOME="$TMPHOME" gaia daemon start
HOME="$TMPHOME" gaia daemon stop
rm -rf "$TMPHOME"
```

## The `tui` prefix

A leading `tui` word is accepted and dropped — `gaia-tui tui list` and `gaia-tui
list` are the same command — so the `gaia tui …` form used elsewhere in the docs
keeps working.

## Contributing: colours

New colours are added to `internal/ui/theme` and addressed by role
(`theme.Text`, `theme.Danger`, `theme.Accent`…) — never a raw
`lipgloss.Color("NNN")` in a screen file. Keep package-level colour vars as
`lipgloss.Style` values and call `.Render()` where the string is actually
used; a `.Render()` called at package-init time bakes in a string before
`theme.Init()` has picked light or dark, so it never changes again.
