# Phase 1 Instructions — Corpus Generation + Architecture Audit

## GOAL
Build the full eval corpus (18 documents with known facts) and the architecture audit module.
Write everything to disk. Do NOT run any eval scenarios yet.

## PART A: Update/Create Corpus Documents

### A1. Verify existing documents match required facts

Check `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\documents\` — currently has:
- acme_q3_report.md
- budget_2025.md
- employee_handbook.md
- product_comparison.html (already correct)

**Update `employee_handbook.md`** to embed these EXACT verifiable facts:
- First-year PTO: **15 days**
- Remote work: **Up to 3 days/week with manager approval. Fully remote requires VP approval.**
- Contractors: **NOT eligible for health benefits (full-time employees only)**
- Section structure: 12 sections numbered 1-12

**Update `acme_q3_report.md`** to embed these EXACT verifiable facts:
- Q3 2025 revenue: **$14.2 million**
- YoY growth: **23% increase from Q3 2024's $11.5 million**
- CEO Q4 outlook: **Projected 15-18% growth driven by enterprise segment expansion**
- Employee count: **NOT mentioned anywhere** (for hallucination resistance testing)

### A2. Create new corpus documents

**Create `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\documents\sales_data_2025.csv`**
500 rows of sales data with columns: date,product,units,unit_price,revenue,region,salesperson
Rules:
- Best-selling product in March 2025: **Widget Pro X, 142 units, $28,400 revenue** (unit_price=$200)
- Q1 2025 total revenue: **$342,150**
- Top salesperson: **Sarah Chen, $67,200**
- Use random seed 42 for all other data
- Date range: 2025-01-01 to 2025-03-31
- Products: Widget Pro X, Widget Basic, Gadget Plus, Gadget Lite, Service Pack
- Regions: North, South, East, West
- Salespeople: Sarah Chen, John Smith, Maria Garcia, David Kim, Emily Brown

**Create `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\documents\api_reference.py`**
A Python file with docstrings documenting a fictional REST API.
Must embed: **Authentication uses Bearer token via the Authorization header**
Include: 3-4 endpoint functions with full docstrings, type hints, example usage

**Create `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\documents\meeting_notes_q3.txt`**
Plain text meeting notes. Must embed: **Next meeting: October 15, 2025 at 2:00 PM**
Include: attendees, agenda items, decisions, action items

**Create `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\documents\large_report.md`**
A long markdown document (~75 "pages" worth of content, ~15,000 words).
Must embed in Section 52 equivalent: **"Three minor non-conformities in supply chain documentation"**
(This tests deep retrieval — the fact must be buried deep in the document)
Use realistic-looking audit/compliance report content.

**Create adversarial documents:**
- `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\adversarial\empty.txt` — empty file (0 bytes)
- `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\adversarial\unicode_test.txt` — text with heavy Unicode: Chinese, Arabic, emoji, mathematical symbols, mixed scripts
- `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\adversarial\duplicate_sections.md` — markdown with 5 identical sections repeated 3 times each (tests deduplication)

Create the `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\adversarial\` directory if it doesn't exist.

## PART B: Create corpus manifest.json

Write `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\corpus\manifest.json`:

## PART C: Architecture Audit

Write `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\src\gaia\eval\audit.py`:

This module performs a deterministic (no LLM) inspection of the GAIA agent architecture to identify structural limitations before running scenarios.

```

## PART D: Run the Architecture Audit

After writing audit.py, run it:
```
uv run python C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\src\gaia\eval\audit.py
```

Write the output to `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\results\phase1\architecture_audit.json`

## PART E: Verify

After all steps, verify:
1. All corpus documents exist with correct content
2. manifest.json is valid JSON with all documents listed
3. audit.py runs without errors
4. architecture_audit.json was written

Write a completion report to `C:\Users\you\Work\gaia4\eval\results\phase1\phase1_complete.md` summarizing what was created and any issues found.

## IMPORTANT
- Use absolute Windows paths (C:\...) for all file operations
- Do NOT delete any files
- The CSV must have exactly the right totals for testing (Sarah Chen=$67,200, Widget Pro X in March=142 units/$28,400, Q1 total=$342,150)
- For the large_report.md, the buried fact must appear after substantial content (simulate being on "page 52" by placing it ~75% through the document)
