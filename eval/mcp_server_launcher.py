"""Launch the Agent UI MCP server with its stderr preserved.

The eval spawns this server once per scenario, as a grandchild: the runner
starts ``claude -p``, and ``claude -p`` starts the server. When the server dies
the client reports only ``CONNECTION_CLOSED``, and the server's own stderr goes
nowhere — it is not the scenario subprocess, so capturing *that* process's
output (#3375) does not reach it either.

Three runs of the eval gate were spent inferring a cause from timings that one
line of this log would have stated outright. So: exec the real server in-process
with stderr tee'd to a file that stays on the runner for triage.

stdout is untouched and unbuffered. It carries the MCP protocol, and a single
stray byte on it desynchronises the client — which is why the diagnostics go to
a file rather than to stderr-as-console or, worse, to stdout.
