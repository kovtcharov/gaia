## Turn Results

### Turn 1 — Prices ✅ (10/10)
**Q:** What products are being compared and how do their prices differ?
**Result:** Agent correctly identified StreamLine ($49/mo), ProFlow ($79/mo), and $30/month difference.
**Tools used:** `query_documents`, `search_file`, `list_indexed_documents`, `query_specific_file` (failed), `index_document` (failed)

### Turn 2 — Integrations ❌ (0/10)
**Q:** Which product has more integrations and by how much?
**Result:** Agent returned a garbled/incomplete response. No integration counts stated.
**Root cause:** `query_specific_file` failed repeatedly — agent used truncated path `C:\Users\you\product_comparison.html` instead of the full indexed path. Agent did not fall back to `query_documents`.
**Tools used:** `query_specific_file` (failed), `list_indexed_documents`

### Turn 3 — Star Ratings ✅ (10/10)
**Q:** What about the star ratings for each product?
**Result:** Agent correctly stated StreamLine=4.2 stars and ProFlow=4.7 stars.
**Tools used:** `query_specific_file` (succeeded with short filename `product_comparison.html`)

## Issues Observed

1. **Path resolution bug in `query_specific_file`:** The tool fails when the agent constructs a Windows path without the full directory. In Turn 2, the agent used `C:\Users\you\product_comparison.html` instead of the correct full path. In Turn 3, using just the filename `product_comparison.html` succeeded. This inconsistency caused Turn 2 to fail entirely.

2. **MCP tool deregistration:** The `send_message` MCP tool repeatedly deregistered between turns, requiring manual re-fetching and causing Turn 2's question to be sent 3 times (visible as duplicate user messages in the session trace).

3. **No fallback to `query_documents`:** In Turns 2 and 3, when `query_specific_file` failed, the agent did not fall back to the more robust `query_documents` tool that worked well in Turn 1.

---

## Recommendations

- Fix `query_specific_file` to accept short filenames and resolve them against the document index
- Investigate MCP tool deregistration issue in multi-turn eval sessions
- Add agent prompt guidance to fall back to `query_documents` when `query_specific_file` fails
