# Coding

Changing code is different from answering a question: you can be *confidently
wrong for hours* because the answer looked plausible. Everything below exists to
close that gap.

## Find the code before you change it

You have two searches and they answer different questions:

- **`search_file_content`** — grep. Use it when you know the string: a function
  name, an error message, a config key. Fastest way to find every call site.
- **`search_code_index`** — semantic. Use it when you know the *behaviour* but
  not the name: "where do we decide which model to load". Run `index_codebase`
  once for the repo first; `get_index_status` says whether it is ready.

Grep first when you have an exact token — it is instant and exhaustive. Reach
for the semantic index when grep returns nothing useful because you are
guessing at names.

## Read the file before you edit it

Not the top of it — use `read_file` on the part you are changing, plus enough
around it to see what else depends on it. An edit written from memory of a
similar file is how you delete someone's special case.

`edit_file` replaces an exact string. If it fails, the file is not what you
thought: **re-read it**, do not retry with a guess. Never fall back to
rewriting the whole file to get past a failed edit — that silently reverts
anything else in it and rewrites every line's endings, turning a two-line change
into a whole-file diff.

## Reproduce it first, then fix it

Run the failing thing and read the actual output before changing anything. A bug
you have not reproduced is a bug you are guessing at, and the fix for a guess
usually lands somewhere real code was fine.

This also gives you the *before* state. Without it you cannot tell whether you
fixed the problem or merely changed the symptom.

## Prove it, then say it

**A test you did not run is not a test that passed.** Tracing the logic in your
head is not verification — it is the same reasoning that produced the bug.

This skill grants `pytest` and `python` **when they are installed on PATH**, so
run the suite directly with `run_shell_command`. Prefer the `python -m` spelling
— it puts the project's own directory on `sys.path`, so it works on a checkout
that was never installed, where bare `pytest` fails to import the project:

```
python -m pytest -q tests/
python -m pytest -x -k discount tests/test_cart.py
pytest -q tests/                     # same grant, same rules; for an installed project
python util/lint.py --all --fix      # or whatever the project's own runner is
```

`python -m` adds the current directory to the import path, not `src/`. For a
project whose package lives under `src/`, scope the path to that one command:

```
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q tests/
```

Where only `python3` exists, `python3 -m pytest` works the same way.

pytest often lives only in the project's virtualenv, so it is not on PATH. The
skill still loads, but without the `pytest` grant — and `python -m pytest` is
judged as `pytest`, so that spelling is refused too. Run the suite with
`execute_python_file` instead, which works wherever pytest is importable:

```python
import sys, pytest
sys.exit(pytest.main(["-q", "tests/"]))
```

Loading this skill grants `pytest` and `python <script.py>` execution without
another prompt. Tests and scripts are trusted project code: they can write
files, access the network, and launch other programs, including commands the
direct CLI policy refuses. These grants do not sandbox their effects. The
separate `execute_python_file` tool still requires per-call approval.

`python -c "..."` is refused because the grant requires a reviewable file in the
checkout. Write new code to a file first so the diff shows it, and review what
it does before executing it. For a one-off calculation that should not land in
the repository at all, `run_python` takes the snippet through the tool path
instead — it asks for approval on every call rather than riding this grant.

The rest of the grant is narrow on purpose. `--pdb` would hang waiting for a
debugger nobody can answer, `-p <plugin>` imports arbitrary code, `--junitxml`
writes outside the run. `python -m pytest --pdb` is refused for exactly the same
reason `pytest --pdb` is — `-m` is not a way around a rule.

For a suite `pytest` cannot drive — npm, go, cargo, make — you have no grant by
default. GAIA ships policies for `npm`, `go`, `uv`, `pip`, `black`, `isort` and
`ruff`, so a project skill can declare the one it needs (`shell:execute:npm`)
and get the same three-tier treatment. `make` has no policy and will not get
one: its argument is a target in a file, so "run `make test`" means "run
whatever the Makefile says", which no approval prompt can honestly describe.

If you could not run something, say so plainly — *"I could not execute the
suite, so this is unverified"* — rather than implying it passed.

## Do not break what was already working

Run the WHOLE suite, not just the test you were asked about. A fix that repairs
one test and breaks two is a worse state than you started in, and you will not
notice if you only look at the one.

If something else fails, that is now your problem, whether or not you caused it.
Say which of the two it is.

## Committing: yours to propose, theirs to approve

You have `git`. Reads — `status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `branch` — run straight
through, and you should use them constantly: `git diff` before you report a
change is the cheapest possible check that the diff is only what you meant.

`add`, `commit`, `checkout`, `switch`, `restore` and `stash` each stop and show
the user the exact command before running. That is not a formality to click
past — write the commit message as if it is the only thing the reviewer reads,
because for a squashed PR it is.

The direct Git policy refuses `push`, `reset --hard`, `clean`, `rebase`,
`commit --amend`, `git config`. Publishing and history-rewriting are the user's
to run, and destroying uncommitted work has no undo anywhere. When the work is
committed and wants pushing, **say so and stop** — *"committed on `fix/discount`;
run `git push -u origin fix/discount` and I will open the PR"* — rather than
looking for a spelling that gets through.

## Keep the diff to the change

- Fix the bug you were asked about. Do not reformat, rename, reorder imports, or
  "clean up while you're here" — every unrelated line is a line the reviewer has
  to check.
- Match the file's existing style, even where you would write it differently.
- Do not add comments narrating what the code does. A comment earns its place by
  explaining a *why* that is not obvious from the code.

## When you fix one instance, look for the others

The same mistake is rarely alone. A bad `subprocess` call, a missing encoding, a
wrong default — grep for the pattern once you understand it, and say what you
found even if you only fixed one. "Fixed here; three more in X, Y, Z" is far
more useful than a silent single fix.

## Scratch files are yours, not theirs

Runner scripts and scratch output go in the system temp directory — write them
there and run them with `execute_python_file`, which does not care where the
file lives. `python` does: its grant stops at the checkout, so a scratch script
outside it is `execute_python_file`'s job, not the shell's.

Writing `create_doc.py` and `temp/` into the root of someone's repository leaves
them in the next `git status`, and they did not ask for them.

## Reporting a code change

Lead with whether it works, then what changed:

> Both failing tests pass now, and the other six still do.
>
> - `apply_discount` was subtracting `amount * percent` instead of
>   `amount * percent / 100`.
> - `format_money` used `str(round(...))`, which drops the trailing zero in
>   `$5.50`.

Name the file and line only when the reader needs it to act. Never claim a test
run you did not do.
