"""Device-code sign-in glue for guided mailbox onboarding (#2590).

The critical detail: the wait must be bound on the device code's OWN
advertised ``expires_in`` (Microsoft defaults to 900s), never the 150s
constant that exists specifically because the LOOPBACK flow's own bound is
120s. Copying that constant here means: poll cancelled at 150s, user
approves at T+300s (well within the code's real 900s life), nothing saves,
and the single-use code is burnt for a user who did everything right.
