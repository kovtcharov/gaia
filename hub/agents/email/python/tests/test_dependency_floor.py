"""Guards the amd-gaia dependency floor against the agent's real core needs.

The email agent imports ``get_embedding_model_for_device`` from
``gaia.agents.registry`` at module load; that symbol first shipped in core
v0.22.0. With a lower floor a fresh resolver may legally select an older
core and the agent dies at startup with ImportError (#2112). These tests
pin the floor to the symbol so the two can't silently drift apart again:
if the floor is lowered, or the agent grows an import the declared floor
doesn't cover, one of these fails.

The guided Outlook walkthrough (#2590) adds a second such import:
``gaia_agent_email.tools.setup_walkthrough`` imports ``gaia.connectors.
setup_routes``, a brand-new core module that ships in the NEXT core
release, not the current 0.22.0. **The pyproject floor cannot be bumped to
express that yet** — a dependency declaration can only name a released
version, and bumping it to an unreleased one makes the package
uninstallable everywhere:

    $ uv pip install --dry-run -e . -e hub/agents/email/python
    × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
    ╰─▶ Because only amd-gaia<0.23.0 is available and
        gaia-agent-email==0.5.0 depends on amd-gaia[api]>=0.23.0, we can
        conclude that gaia-agent-email==0.5.0 cannot be used. And because
        only gaia-agent-email==0.5.0 is available and you require
        gaia-agent-email, we can conclude that your requirements are
        unsatisfiable.

So the floor here stays at 0.22.0 (bump it once the release containing
``setup_routes`` is cut) and this file only asserts the module is
importable against whatever core IS resolved locally — it does not, and
cannot, guard the published-sidecar-vs-old-core case. That gate belongs at
publish time instead: see the core-version check in
``.github/workflows/release_agent_email.yml``, which refuses to publish a
build whose resolved core lacks ``gaia.connectors.setup_routes``.

``gaia.agents.base.trust_ledger`` is a third such import (the earn-trust
engine generalized into core; ``trust.py`` subclasses it at module load).
It ships in the first core release after 0.23.0 and is covered by the same
publish-time gate.
