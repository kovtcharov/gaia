# Email agent — frozen binary packaging

Builds the GAIA email agent into a single self-contained executable that boots its
REST server with **no Python interpreter present** on the target machine. This is
the Python side of the email-agent-packaging milestone
(`docs/plans/email-agent-packaging.mdx`); the npm side (`@amd-gaia/agent-email`)
fetches and spawns this binary as a sidecar.

The binary serves the full email REST surface — `/v1/email/triage`, `/draft`,
`/send` (the frozen `#1262` contract) plus `/health` and `/version`.

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `server.py` | Minimal FastAPI app mounting only the email router + `/health` + `/version`. The freeze entrypoint (not the whole `gaia api` app, which drags in every agent + the ML stack). |
| `freeze.py` | PyInstaller build. Bakes in the gotcha fixes below. |
| `smoke_test.py` | Launches the built binary as a subprocess and checks `/health`, OpenAPI, `/version`, and a triage round-trip. Used by `release_agent_email.yml`. |
| `gen_binaries_lock.py` | Regenerates `hub/agents/email/npm/binaries.lock.json` from the publish summary (hub URLs + SHA-256). |
| `publish_to_r2.py` | **The release upload path.** POSTs each binary + `gaia-agent.yaml` to the Agent Hub Worker's `POST /publish` (`release_agent_email.yml`), which checksums server-side, stores immutably under `agents/email/<ver>/`, and rebuilds `index.json`. |
| `upload_to_r2.sh` | **Legacy / discouraged.** Hand-upload via rclone straight to the bucket — this **bypasses the Worker**, so `index.json` is NOT rebuilt. Use `publish_to_r2.py` instead. See [`HUB-UPLOAD.md`](HUB-UPLOAD.md). |
| `HUB-UPLOAD.md` | Manual rclone upload guide (the legacy bypass path). |

Build artifacts (`build/`, `dist/`, `*.spec`) are git-ignored; binaries are never committed.

## Build

```bash
# from a venv with .[api] + the email package + pyinstaller installed (see Setup)
python hub/agents/email/python/packaging/freeze.py            # one-dir (default, recommended)
python hub/agents/email/python/packaging/freeze.py --onefile  # one-file (single .exe)
```

| Mode | Output | Size | Cold-start to `/health` |
|------|--------|------|--------------------------|
| **one-dir** (recommended) | `dist/email-agent/email-agent.exe` (+ `_internal/`) | ~86 MB | ~3.4 s |
| one-file | `dist/email-agent.exe` | ~42 MB | ~5.9 s |

Build time ≈ 150–170 s. **Prefer one-dir** as the distributed artifact: faster
start, no per-launch self-extraction to `%TEMP%`, and cleaner to code-sign (sign
the `.exe`, ship the folder). One-file is the smaller *download* but pays a
self-extraction cost on each launch. **PyInstaller, not Nuitka** — the four
`--paths` / `--collect-submodules` / `--copy-metadata` knobs below resolve every
dependency; keep Nuitka only as a fallback if a future dep defeats the hooks.

## Launch

```bash
dist/email-agent/email-agent.exe --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8131
```

Flags: `--host` (default `127.0.0.1`), `--port` (default **8131** — deliberately
not 4001), `--print-openapi` (dump OpenAPI and exit — note `gaia.logger` prepends
a stdout log line; read the last line or use `/openapi.json`).

`/health`, `/version`, and `/openapi.json` are dependency-free, so the binary
boots and serves the contract surface with no model. `POST /v1/email/triage`
uses the **real local Lemonade model** and requires a reachable Lemonade Server;
if there is none it returns **HTTP 502 (`local LLM triage failed`)**.

### Caller authentication (#1706)

The sidecar can send mail as the user, so it authenticates its caller. The
spawning parent hands over a per-session token through one of two channels:

- **`GAIA_EMAIL_SIDECAR_TOKEN_FILE`** (preferred) — the path of a `0600`,
  owner-only file holding the token. The GAIA daemon's sidecar manager writes
  it on spawn and removes it on sidecar exit, so the secret never sits in the
  process environment. If the variable is set but the file is missing or
  empty, startup fails loudly (never a silent auth-off).
- **`GAIA_EMAIL_SIDECAR_TOKEN`** (legacy) — the token directly in the
  environment. Still honored for older spawning parents (e.g. the
  `@amd-gaia/agent-email` lifecycle) and bare integrators; if both are set,
  the file wins.

Every `/v1/email/*` request must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or it is
rejected with **401**. An absent or non-loopback `Host` → **400** (DNS-rebinding) and a
non-loopback browser `Origin` → **403** (drive-by page); `/health`, `/version`,
`/v1/email/spec`, and `/v1/email/playground` are exempt from the token. Launching
by hand with neither variable disables the token check (local dev only, logged
loudly) — Host/Origin protection still applies.

## Smoke test

```bash
python hub/agents/email/python/packaging/smoke_test.py dist/email-agent/email-agent.exe
```

Launches the binary only (no `python -m`), polls `/health`, then checks OpenAPI,
`/version`, and a triage round-trip whose response is validated against the real
contract via `gaia_agent_email.contract.parse_response` (not a string match). The
triage body is derived from `tests/fixtures/email/synthetic_inbox.mbox`.

## Build gotchas (baked into `freeze.py`)

1. **Editable installs are invisible to PyInstaller.** `-e` installs aren't found
   by the static analyzer (`ModuleNotFoundError: gaia_agent_email` at runtime).
   Fix: `--paths` to the source roots (`hub/agents/email/python`, `src`). A
   non-editable wheel install in CI won't need this; local editable builds do.
2. **uvicorn string-imports its impls** (loops/protocols/lifespan). Fix:
   `--collect-submodules uvicorn`.
3. **keyring resolves OS backends via entry points.** `gaia.connectors.store`
   imports `keyring` at module load. Fix: `--collect-submodules keyring` **and**
   `--copy-metadata keyring`. The binary boots and mounts the router (keyring
   imports under freeze); the actual credential-store *read* (Windows DPAPI needs
   `pywin32`) is exercised only once `/send` is wired with a connected mailbox.
4. **Lazy tool imports on the triage path.** The router imports tool modules
   inside functions. Fix: `--collect-submodules gaia_agent_email`.
5. **The ML stack bloats the freeze.** The triage path lazily reaches
   `gaia.chat.sdk` → torch/transformers/faiss (~2 GB). Real triage talks to the
   local Lemonade Server over HTTP (no in-process torch), so `freeze.py`
   **excludes** them, cutting the binary to <90 MB.
6. **One-file orphans its child on kill.** The one-file bootloader spawns a child;
   `terminate()` on the parent leaves the uvicorn child (and its socket) alive.
   The host sidecar supervisor MUST kill the process **tree** (`@amd-gaia/agent-email`
   does this).

## Per-platform notes

Each platform must build **natively** (PyInstaller doesn't cross-compile) — the
release workflow's matrix does this. No blocker expected for `darwin-arm64`,
`darwin-x64`, `linux-x64` (pure-python + fastapi/uvicorn/pydantic/keyring, all
with hooks). Watch items:

- **keyring backend swaps per OS** (macOS Keychain, Linux SecretService). The
  collect/copy-metadata flags should carry them; the live read wants a per-OS
  check once `/send` is wired.
- **macOS** needs sign + notarize (else Gatekeeper blocks the bundled binary).
- **Linux** build on the oldest target glibc (manylinux-style) for broad compat.

## Setup (reproduce)

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[api]"
uv pip install -e hub/agents/email/python
uv pip install pyinstaller
```

> **Corporate-TLS:** if `uv pip install` fails with `invalid peer certificate:
> UnknownIssuer` behind a proxy, add `--system-certs`. Hosted CI runners don't
> hit this.
