Publish frozen email-agent binaries to the GAIA Agent Hub R2 Worker
(milestone #49, issue #1648).

POSTs each artifact + the agent's ``gaia-agent.yaml`` to the Worker's
``POST /publish`` endpoint (multipart/form-data, Bearer auth). The Worker
computes the SHA-256 server-side and stores the object immutably at
``agents/<id>/<version>/<filename>``. A single ``<id>/<version>`` accepts
multiple per-platform binaries (each a distinct filename) — see the Worker
README.

Idempotency (re-running a published release is a no-op):
  * 201 -> published. We assert the Worker-returned SHA-256 equals the SHA-256
    we computed locally (integrity/atomicity check).
  * 409 (version_exists) -> the filename is already published. We GET the stored
    object and assert its bytes hash to the SAME SHA-256 we hold. If they match
    it is a true no-op (success); if they DIFFER we fail loudly — that means a
    different binary is already published under this immutable name.

NO silent fallback: any other non-2xx, a SHA mismatch, or a missing token
raises with an actionable message.

Auth: the Bearer token is read from the ``AGENT_HUB_PUBLISH_TOKEN`` environment
variable ONLY. It is never logged, echoed, or written to disk.

Usage::

    AGENT_HUB_PUBLISH_TOKEN=*** python publish_to_r2.py \
        --base-url https://hub.example.workers.dev \
        --manifest hub/agents/email/python/gaia-agent.yaml \
        --artifact dist/email-agent-win32-x64.exe=win32-x64 \
        [--artifact dist/email-agent-linux-x64=linux-x64 ...] \
        [--summary-out published.json]

Each ``--artifact`` is ``<path>[=<platform-key>]``. The platform key is recorded
in the summary JSON (consumed by gen_binaries_lock.py); if omitted it is
inferred from the filename suffix.
