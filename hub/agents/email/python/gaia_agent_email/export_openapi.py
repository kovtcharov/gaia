Export the OpenAPI spec for the email REST surface (``/v1/email/*``) — #1645.

The committed ``openapi.email.json`` is the **cross-implementation source of
truth** for the email contract: the ``@amd-gaia/agent-email`` npm client and the
future C++ build both conform to it. This module both *produces* that artifact
and lets CI *diff* it, so a route or schema change that isn't regenerated fails
loudly instead of silently drifting from the published contract.

The spec is built from a minimal FastAPI app that mounts ONLY the email router —
the same ``gaia_agent_email.api_routes.router`` the product server
(``gaia.api.openai_server``) and the freeze server mount — so the exported spec
is byte-for-byte what a host serves, with none of the unrelated ``gaia api``
routes.

Usage::

    # Regenerate the committed artifact (run after changing routes/contract):
    python -m gaia_agent_email.export_openapi

    # CI drift check — non-zero exit if the committed file is stale:
    python -m gaia_agent_email.export_openapi --check
