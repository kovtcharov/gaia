"""Calendar tools — list events, RSVP to invites, create events from emails,
detect meeting requests embedded in an email body, and flag scheduling
conflicts against the user's calendar.

``accept_invite``, ``decline_invite``, ``create_event_from_email`` are
declared in the agent's ``CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED_TOOLS`` (merged with the
generic base set via ``confirmation_required_tools()``, #1440) —
calendar mutations are externally visible to other attendees.
``detect_meeting_request`` and ``detect_calendar_conflicts`` are read-only
(they inspect text / read the calendar but make no changes) and are NOT
confirmation-gated.

Conflict detection is deterministic interval arithmetic — no LLM. It is the
natural follow-on to meeting detection: detect a meeting → check the proposed
time against the calendar for overlaps.

Meeting detection mirrors the package's two-tier triage
pattern: a deterministic heuristic for the obvious cases, and an LLM
follow-up for the ambiguous ones (soft language with no concrete time, e.g.
"let's sync sometime"). The LLM path follows the same fail-loud contract as
``llm_triage``: an unreachable model, unparseable output, or out-of-schema
value **raises** rather than silently defaulting to "not a meeting".

# 2. The turn called NEITHER calendar tool at all, yet the response still
#    states a conflict verdict citing >=2 specific times — a claim with no
#    tool grounding whatsoever (the emptier, more dangerous cousin of (1);
#    same shape as the "confident claim, empty tool trace" pattern seen
#    elsewhere, e.g. #2621). Reuses ``_TIME_RE`` (already defined above for
#    meeting-request time-signal detection) as the "cites specific events"

            times yourself.

            often ``[]``. Never state who is attending, invited, or coming

            was sent or received an invite — never describe the organizer as
            having "sent an invite". ``organizer_self`` is the provider's

            default-false ``attendees[].organizer`` flag for that attendee, the
            event is externally organized. The result includes ``count`` and a
