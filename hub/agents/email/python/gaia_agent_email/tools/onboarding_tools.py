"""Agent-led mailbox onboarding — the agent fixes its own access (#2469).

The failure this replaces: the user asks "triage my inbox", the pre-scan comes
back ``CONNECTOR_ERROR: All connected mailboxes failed … (credential problem)``,
and the agent's best move is to tell someone sitting in a terminal chat to leave
it, run ``gaia connectors connect google --scopes <scopes> --grant-agent
installed:email``, and come back. Every part of that is the product failing.

What happens instead: the agent works out *which* of the four problems it
actually has (see :mod:`gaia_agent_email.mailbox_state`), says something
specific about that one, and offers to fix it right there — asking, through the
mid-run question primitive, only for what it genuinely cannot determine on its
own.

The whole conversation is scripted **here**, in Python, not improvised by the
model. The model's only decision is whether to call ``setup_mailbox_access``;
what gets asked, in what order, and what each answer does is deterministic —
which is what makes it testable and what stops a 4B local model from inventing
a setup step.

The honest limit
----------------
Connecting Google today still needs the user to supply their own OAuth client id
**and** client secret (there is no first-party GAIA client), and the browser flow
is loopback-only — so it needs a browser on this machine. None of that can be
prompted away. What the agent can do is know exactly when it is about to need
them, say so plainly with a link before asking, and do everything else itself.
Ship a first-party OAuth client and both of those questions disappear from this
flow entirely; nothing else here changes.
