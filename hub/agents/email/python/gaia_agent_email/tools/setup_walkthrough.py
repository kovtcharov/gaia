"""Guided mailbox setup — device-code/loopback sign-in and step walkthrough
(#2590, #2594).

Extends, rather than rewrites, ``onboarding_tools`` (#2469): the scripted
repair conversation stays there, this module holds the walkthrough that
conversation hands off to for a first-time Microsoft or Google connect. Kept
separate because ``onboarding_tools.py`` is already ~600 lines scoped to
*repair*, and the guided walkthrough is a different concern.

**``google_workspace`` and ``microsoft_work`` are still out of scope** — no
account-kind interview, no resumability — see ``gaia.connectors.setup_routes``
and #2594's remaining acceptance criteria for why.

**Credential prompts hide free text only when ``Step.sensitive`` says so.**
Microsoft's Application (client) ID is public by design — nothing on that
route is worth hiding from the TUI's cleartext echo. Google's client secret
IS worth hiding: the TUI renders typed text in cleartext unless a prompt is
marked ``sensitive``, so ``_collect_credential`` threads ``step.sensitive``
through to ``ask(..., sensitive=...)`` rather than hard-coding it per route.
