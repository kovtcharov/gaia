"""Single-shot summarize-the-overflow for long email threads (#1889).

Six-panel adversarial review replaced an earlier multi-pass fold design: the
#1890 spike showed a realistic 30-message thread is only ~4,361 tokens, well
under the budget in ``context_budget.thread_budget_tokens()`` — a thread needs
~120+ messages before it overflows. Multi-pass folding has no evidence base
for that rarity and courts the 180s tool-timeout zombie-thread hazard
(``DEFAULT_TOOL_TIMEOUT``, Lemonade is single-tenant, daemon threads can't be
killed). This module does AT MOST ONE extra LLM call per invocation: bucket
every message older than the latest into one blob, oldest-first, and
condense it with a single hardened LLM call. The latest message always
survives verbatim.

Callers (``api_routes.EmailTriageService._triage_thread_llm`` and
``read_tools.summarize_thread_impl``) own the "does it fit" gate and their
own pre-existing renderer for the fits path; this module owns only the
fold-when-it-doesn't-fit primitive so both surfaces share ONE hardened,
fail-loud implementation instead of two drifting copies.
