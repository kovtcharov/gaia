"""Caller authentication for the email sidecar's local REST API (#1706).

The frozen sidecar binds ``127.0.0.1`` and exposes draft/send against the user's
connected mailbox. A no-auth localhost API is reachable by any *other* local
process and — via DNS-rebinding / a drive-by web page — by the user's browser,
which is not an acceptable posture for a surface that can send mail as the user.
The existing draft→send *confirmation token* is a payload-integrity check (it
binds a send to one exact message); it is NOT caller authentication.

This module adds the missing caller-auth layer. It is wired ONLY onto the sidecar
app (``gaia_agent_email.server``, which the frozen binary freezes) — the product
server (``gaia.api.openai_server``) and the OpenAPI export app mount the same
router unchanged, so their posture is untouched.

Three controls, all keyed on a single :class:`CallerAuthConfig` set at app build:

1. **Per-session bearer token** — the spawning parent (npm ``lifecycle.ts`` or
   the daemon's ``AgentSidecarManager``) generates a cryptographically-random
   token and hands it to the sidecar either as a 0600 file whose path arrives in
   ``GAIA_EMAIL_SIDECAR_TOKEN_FILE`` (preferred, #2149 — the secret never sits
   in the environment) or directly in ``GAIA_EMAIL_SIDECAR_TOKEN`` (legacy).
   Every non-exempt request must present ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` or it
   is rejected with 401. This authenticates the *caller*.
2. **Host allowlist** — the ``Host`` header must be present AND a loopback host
   (127.0.0.1 / localhost / ::1). This closes DNS-rebinding, where a victim's
   browser is tricked into resolving ``evil.com`` → 127.0.0.1 and posting to the
   sidecar (the browser then sends ``Host: evil.com``). An absent or empty
   ``Host`` is refused too, so the control cannot be skipped by omitting it.
3. **Origin rejection** — a request carrying a browser ``Origin`` that is not a
   loopback origin is rejected with 403. This closes a drive-by web page that
   fetches ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>`` directly. Non-browser clients (the npm /
   Python clients, curl) send no ``Origin`` and are unaffected.

Fail-loud: rejections return an actionable status + message, never a silent
degrade. When no token is configured (a developer running the sidecar by hand
without the env var), the token check is skipped and a loud warning is logged —
the Host/Origin controls still apply. Production always spawns via a parent that
sets the token, so the shipped product is always authenticated.
