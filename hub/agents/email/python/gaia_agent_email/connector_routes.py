"""Mailbox-connector routes for the email playground.

Always mounted on the sidecar. The playground page is itself always served, so
gating only its connector routes would leave the page with a dead Connectors
panel — same lifecycle for both is simpler and consistent. Reuses GAIA's
connector framework (``gaia.connectors``) — the same OAuth flow the Agent UI
uses — so a developer can connect a Gmail/Outlook mailbox from the playground
and exercise live ``/v1/email/send``.

Excluded from the OpenAPI schema: a playground convenience, not part of the
frozen email REST contract. ``gaia.connectors`` is already linked into the
binary (the send path resolves the mailbox through it), so these routes add a
surface, not a dependency. The connection itself lives in a machine-global
keyring store shared by every GAIA surface (Agent UI, CLI, this playground), so
a real consuming app can establish it elsewhere and the sidecar's send just
reads it from that shared store.

OAuth completes entirely inside ``gaia.connectors.flow`` — it stands up its own
loopback redirect listener and opens the browser — so this module hosts no
callback route. It only starts the flow and waits for it.
