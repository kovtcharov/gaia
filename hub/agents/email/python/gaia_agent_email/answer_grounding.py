"""Deterministic post-checks on the agent's own final answer text.

The system prompt asks the model to stay honest about what it actually did
and what it actually saw, but prompt compliance is probabilistic — a model
can still narrate a mutation it never called a tool for, contradict a tool
result it just received, or echo internal payload scaffolding into prose.
These functions inspect the FINAL answer text against the turn's own tool
trace (``result["conversation"]``, which ``Agent._process_query_impl``
resets to empty at the start of every call, so it always scopes to exactly
this turn) and either flag or rewrite the parts that are not grounded in
what actually happened.

Every function here is pure and side-effect free — no LLM calls, no I/O —
so the guard is unit-testable without a live model or a live mailbox.
``EmailTriageAgent.process_query`` is the single call site that wires these
into the output boundary.

    Same rationale (#2900): a model paraphrasing a precomputed
    phishing/spam list is exactly the failure mode ``rewrite_triage_answer``
    exists to prevent for ``pre_scan_inbox``'s ``needs_you`` list, and a
    flagged-mail list is higher-stakes to get wrong, not lower. Keyed on
    tool PRESENCE, never question parsing (#2762).

    Deliberately a no-op when ``pre_scan_inbox`` ALSO ran this turn —
    ``rewrite_triage_answer``'s four-bucket card already wins that turn (see
    its own docstring and the pinned #2900 residual-risk test); rendering a
    narrower list here on top would silently discard that card instead of
    leaving it as the documented residual risk.

    The lead sentence is always the grounded summary, never the model's own
    framing, once the scan actually flagged something. A model that opens
    with "Nothing flagged this scan" while ``scan`` carries rows is not a
    formatting slip like a dropped item or bad numbering — it is a clean
    bill of health printed directly above the phishing list this function
    renders, which is worse than the verbosity this rewrite otherwise fixes.
    Unlike ``rewrite_triage_answer``, this has no downstream contradiction
    check to catch a wrong opener (guard 2 only reconciles against
    ``pre_scan_inbox``), so the lead cannot be allowed through unchecked —
    unconditionally preferring the grounded summary is simpler than pattern-
    matching every way a model could phrase a false all-clear, and strictly
    safer.

    Zero findings is normally a no-op (there is no list, so there is
    nothing to protect against paraphrase) — EXCEPT when the scan itself
    was incomplete (``_suspicious_scan_has_coverage_gap``): a failed
    mailbox or a partial inbox pass turns "nothing flagged" from a clean
    bill of health into a false all-clear, the same failure mode this
    function exists to prevent, just with an empty list instead of a wrong
    one (#2900 follow-up). That case unconditionally replaces the answer
    with ``_honest_suspicious_summary`` too, for the same reason as the
    non-empty branch above: detecting whether the model's own prose already
    disclosed the gap is exactly the fragile pattern-matching this module
    already rejected once.
