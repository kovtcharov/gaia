# gaia-agent-chat

The conversational ChatAgent — the class `GaiaAgent` subclasses, so this is a
hard dependency of `gaia-agent` and fully supported as a library. It is no
longer a product of its own: the flagship supersedes its three prompt profiles
(`chat`, `doc`, `file`), and all three are retired as user-facing choices.
Depends on the published `amd-gaia` framework wheel.

## Install

```bash
pip install gaia-agent-chat              # from PyPI (once published — see #2240)
pip install -e hub/agents/chat/python    # editable, for development
uv pip install "gaia-agent-chat @ git+https://github.com/amd/gaia.git#subdirectory=hub/agents/chat/python"  # works today without a repo checkout
```

Installing registers `chat`, `doc`, and `file` via the `gaia.agent` entry-point
group, all marked `hidden`: the registry resolves them by id — which is what
keeps stored sessions, the `*-lite` aliases, and the eval scenarios working —
but they are absent from the Agent UI picker and the Hub catalog. Pick the
flagship `gaia` agent instead.

`gaia chat` and `gaia chat --ui` import `ChatAgent` directly rather than going
through the registry, so both are unaffected by the hidden flag.

## Develop / test

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest hub/agents/chat/python/tests/ -x
```

## Provider migration

The direct OpenAI and LiteLLM adapters are removed. `--use-chatgpt` and
`use_chatgpt=True` remain only to report an actionable migration error before
startup. Configure your model in Lemonade, then select its catalog ID and the
Lemonade server URL. The local Lemonade and Claude routes are unchanged.
See [gateway migration](https://amd-gaia.ai/docs/sdk/sdks/llm#gateway-migration).
