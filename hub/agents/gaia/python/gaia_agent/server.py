"""``POST /v1/gaia/query`` — the flagship agent's canonical streaming surface.

Implements the frozen v2 wire contract (`docs/spec/agent-ui-query-sse-contract.md`):
a `/query` POST returning `text/event-stream`, carrying the canonical event
vocabulary and terminated by **exactly one** ``final`` or ``error``. That
guarantee is what lets the daemon relay and the Go TUI treat every agent
identically.

The event translation itself is NOT reimplemented here — it lives in
``gaia.ui.sse_translation.CanonicalTranslator``, shared with the email sidecar,
so the two agents cannot drift into private dialects of the same contract.

Scope note: the surfaces here are ``/init`` (readiness preflight), ``/query``,
``/query/{run_id}/cancel``, ``/query/{run_id}/respond``,
``/query/{run_id}/followup``, ``/query/{run_id}/tool_decision`` (contract >=
2.14) and ``/sessions/{session_id}/bypass``. ``needs_input`` is answered over
``/respond`` on the run's existing stream; ``needs_confirmation`` is answered
the same way over ``/tool_decision`` — but only when there is a session to
hold the grant AND the caller declared it can answer (``can_confirm`` in
``query()``). A one-shot request (no ``session_id``, or
``can_answer_questions: false``) still ends such a run with a refusal (the
stateless D1 stub, same as email) rather than parking a run nobody can
answer.

:func:`main` also owns the binary's TRANSPORT DISPATCH: ``--serve`` runs this
HTTP surface, anything else delegates to :mod:`gaia_agent.stdio`. One
executable serves both, so the release matrix stays one artifact per platform.
