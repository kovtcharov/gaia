"""``POST /v1/gaia/query`` — the flagship agent's canonical streaming surface.

Implements the frozen v2 wire contract (`docs/spec/agent-ui-query-sse-contract.md`):
a `/query` POST returning `text/event-stream`, carrying the canonical event
vocabulary and terminated by **exactly one** ``final`` or ``error``. That
guarantee is what lets the daemon relay and the Go TUI treat every agent
identically.

The event translation itself is NOT reimplemented here — it lives in
``gaia.ui.sse_translation.CanonicalTranslator``, shared with the email sidecar,
so the two agents cannot drift into private dialects of the same contract.

Scope note: the surfaces here are ``/init`` (readiness preflight), ``/query``,
``/query/{run_id}/cancel`` and ``/query/{run_id}/respond``. ``needs_input`` is
answered over ``/respond`` on the run's existing stream. ``needs_confirmation``
is the one gate still unimplemented: it ends the run with a refusal (the
stateless D1 stub, same as email) rather than pretending to support server-side
resume. That is additive when a tool needs it; claiming support we haven't built
would be worse than the honest gap.
