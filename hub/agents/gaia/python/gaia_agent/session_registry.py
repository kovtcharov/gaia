"""Session-scoped agent retention for the flagship sidecar (#2829, schema 2.12).

Schema 2.12 is the contract version that let ``/query`` resolve a conversation's
agent *by ``session_id``* instead of building a throwaway one per call. Building
per call is not merely wasteful — it silently discards everything the agent
learned during the turn. A skill activated by ``load_skill`` lives on
``Agent.loaded_skills``, so a throwaway agent means the very next turn reports
no skills loaded while the model, having just said "it's loaded", keeps
promising otherwise.

Started as a deliberate mirror of ``gaia_agent_email.agent_routes._SessionRegistry``
— same idle-TTL + LRU bounds, same claim-the-lock eviction — and has since
diverged: this one reserves a slot while an agent builds so the cap is a real
bound, and tears agents down through ``close()``, which the email agent does not
have. The duplication is a known cost; extracting one shared registry into core
touches the email agent's tested paths and belongs in its own change.
