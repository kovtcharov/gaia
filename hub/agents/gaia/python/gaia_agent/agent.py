"""``GaiaAgent`` — the flagship general-purpose agent.

This is the agent a new user meets first: conversation, document Q&A over their
own files, data exploration, web research, and a memory that persists across
sessions — extended by skills rather than by shipping a new agent per task.

**It composes ``ChatAgent`` rather than forking it.** ChatAgent's ``doc`` profile
already carries the RAG prompt, smart document discovery, cross-turn session
persistence, memory v2, and MCP. Duplicating that to get a flagship would mean
maintaining two copies of the hardest-won prompt in the repo. What GaiaAgent adds
is *breadth*: the capability flags ChatAgent leaves off by default, plus a bundled
skill library.

Why breadth is a requirement and not a preference
-------------------------------------------------
``tools_required`` in a ``SKILL.md`` is **advisory** — the loader logs at INFO when
a declared tool is absent and loads the skill anyway. So a skill dropped into an
agent that lacks its tools does not fail at load; it fails mid-run when the model
calls a tool that was never registered. A general-purpose skill host therefore has
to carry the union of what its skills can ask for, or the failure surfaces to the
user as a broken answer instead of a clear refusal. The starter pack's needs map
directly onto the flags below:

    document-brief   -> RAG            (the ``doc`` prompt profile)
    data-explore     -> scratchpad     (``enable_scratchpad``)
    research-report  -> browser + file (``enable_browser`` + ``enable_filesystem``)
    check-in         -> memory         (on by default in the base agent)
    github-triage    -> MCP connector  (inherited from ChatAgent)

Skills are discovered from the bundled ``skills/`` directory (highest-precedence
root) and declared in ``gaia-agent.yaml``. Following the email agent's precedent
(#2848), **no skill set loads by default** — the manifest ships its
``default_skill_set`` commented out until an eval measures the prompt-token cost.
Skills are opt-in via ``--skill-set``, ``GAIA_SKILL_SET``, or — mid-session — the
skill-library tools in :mod:`gaia.agents.tools.skill_library_tools`, which let the model
discover, install, load, and unload skills on demand without a restart. Those
tools never load anything on their own, so the out-of-the-box prompt budget is
unchanged.
