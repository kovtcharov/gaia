"""Run the flagship agent over stdin/stdout as newline-delimited JSON.

The collapsed transport: the TUI spawns this process once and keeps it, writing
one query per line to stdin and reading canonical events back as JSON lines. No
daemon, no HTTP port, no bearer token, no discovery file, no contract
negotiation, no model-slot lease — the failure modes those layers introduce
cannot occur because the layers are not there.

Two properties matter and both come from the process being long-lived:

* **The agent is built once.** Construction costs ~42s (embedding validation,
  two FAISS index rebuilds, scratchpad DB, filesystem index, web client); the
  turn itself costs ~2.5s. Building per request made every turn pay the 42s.
* **Anything the agent learns persists.** ``Agent.loaded_skills`` in particular:
  a skill activated in one turn is still active in the next, because it is the
  same object.

Subsystems are still constructed eagerly by ``GaiaAgent.__init__`` — making them
lazy is the remaining win, and it is what would let this process start instantly
and survive Lemonade not being up yet.

The chat model is Lemonade by default; ``--use-claude`` swaps it for the
Anthropic API (``--claude-model`` picks the model) at launch, and ``/model``
(see ``run_model_command``) swaps it live, mid-session — the client is
replaced in place on the same ``agent``/``agent.chat`` objects, so
``conversation_history`` and ``loaded_skills`` survive a switch that a child
respawn would destroy. Embeddings (RAG, memory, code index) stay on Lemonade
either way — Anthropic has no embeddings API.

A live switch is process-local: if the child ever respawns (the Go side kills
it when a cancelled turn will not stop, or it crashed — see
``client.SubprocessClient``'s ``discard``/respawn), the NEW process comes up
from the ORIGINAL ``--use-claude``/``--claude-model`` argv again, not from
whatever ``/model`` last set. This module cannot prevent that — there is no argv to persist a
switch into short of the TUI re-issuing it — so the Go side instead detects
the mismatch from this module's own startup ping and tells the user their
model reverted (see ``handleCanonicalEvent`` in ``canonical.go``).

The event vocabulary is the canonical one (``status`` / ``tool_call`` /
``tool_result`` / ``token`` / ``final`` / ``error``), identical to what the HTTP
surface emits, so the renderer does not care which transport it is reading.
Exactly one terminal event (``final`` or ``error``) ends every turn.

stdin carries three kinds of line. A plain line is a query. ``/model`` and
``/model <id>`` (see ``is_model_command``) are intercepted before the query
ever reaches ``agent.process_query`` — the LLM never has to "answer" a slash
command. A JSON object with a ``gaia_control`` key is a **control message** —
the back-channel a permission prompt needs: without one the agent can ask "may
I run this?" and the answer has nowhere to travel, so every gated tool
eventually auto-denies. Control messages are read by a dedicated thread so
they still land *while* a turn is in flight, which is the only moment a
confirmation decision is worth anything — and the only moment ``cancel`` (stop
this turn, keep the process) can land. ``/model`` is deliberately NOT a
control message: its response (the switched-to model, or why it was refused)
has to reach the transport's reader, which only scans stdout *during* a turn
(see ``client.SubprocessClient`` on the Go side) — so it rides the query
channel like a real turn instead, guaranteeing the same one-terminal-event
window a control ack could not.
