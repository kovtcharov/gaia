"""Drift gate for the flagship's ``full``-profile tool bundles.

``FULL_CORE_TOOLS`` union all ``FULL_BUNDLES`` members must equal the live
flagship registry **exactly**, in both directions:

* a registry tool covered by neither would still be semantically selectable but
  could never be pulled in with its cohort, nor recovered through
  ``load_tools`` — the escape hatch resolves bundle *and* tool names through the
  bundle reverse index, so an unbundled tool has no way back;
* a configured name absent from the registry is dead config (or a typo) that
  ``ToolLoader.validate_registry`` rejects at runtime, unless it is declared in
  ``FULL_OPTIONAL_TOOLS``.

This lives beside the flagship rather than in ``tests/unit/`` because the
``full`` registry is GaiaAgent's, not ChatAgent's: 11 of its tools come from the
skill-library and code-index mixins this package composes. The sibling guard for
the ``doc`` profile is ``tests/unit/test_chat_tool_bundles.py``.
