"""Run lifecycle on ``POST /v1/gaia/query``.

Every test here drives the real ``build_app()`` over HTTP with a scripted agent
injected at the two construction seams. A mocked route would prove the handler
was called; only the real app proves a one-shot agent is actually torn down, a
duplicate ``run_id`` is actually refused, and the SSE contract still ends each
run with exactly one terminal event.

What these pin, and the bug each one caught:

* **One-shot teardown** — ``/query`` without a ``session_id`` built an agent that
  nothing ever closed, so a host issuing one-shot queries accumulated a RAG/FAISS
  index, a scratchpad DB handle and an HTTP session per request until the process
  died.
* **Duplicate run_id** — the run table took the newer run over the older one, so
  the older became uncancellable and either stream's teardown dropped the other's
  entry. ``run_id`` is client-minted, so a client bug reaches this.
* **Per-turn model** — a retained session ignored a changed ``model``, answering
  on the old one with no error at all.
* **Cancel before start** — ``run_id`` is minted before the POST, so a cancel can
  legitimately arrive first; it used to be dropped and the run proceeded.
* **Unsafe session_id** — an id that can't be a session file name (``../x``,
  ``a:b``) came back as a 500; it is the caller's error and must be a 400.
