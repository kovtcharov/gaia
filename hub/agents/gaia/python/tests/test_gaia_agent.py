"""Contract tests for the flagship ``gaia`` agent.

The load-bearing one is :func:`test_registers_every_capability_the_starter_skills_need`.
``tools_required`` in a ``SKILL.md`` is advisory — the loader logs at INFO when a
declared tool is missing and loads the skill anyway — so a capability gap here
does not fail at load, it fails mid-run as a broken answer. These assertions are
the only thing standing between a config regression and that failure mode.

Measured, not assumed: ``prompt_profile="doc"`` with ``enable_scratchpad`` and
``enable_browser`` both True registers 38 tools and ZERO of either, because
``ChatAgent._register_tools`` keys off ``ProfileSpec.tool_groups`` and never reads
those flags. That is why the profile is ``"full"``.

Determinism
-----------
``MemoryMixin`` disables itself when the embedder is unreachable, so a plain
construction registers five fewer tools on a machine without Lemonade — an
environment-dependent count that made the drift guard pass on a dev box and fail
in CI, where there is no server. Both surfaces are therefore pinned here rather
than observed: memory init is forced off (``GAIA_MEMORY_DISABLED``), then
registration is re-run with a store present. Cold and warm now agree, so the
only thing that can move these counts is a real config change.
