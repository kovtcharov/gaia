"""Skill-body prompt-budget regression (#2848 follow-up).

The bug this guards against: once ``load_skill`` activates a skill, its full
``SKILL.md`` body used to render in the system prompt on every subsequent
turn for the life of the session — regardless of whether that turn had
anything to do with it. Measured on this agent's two bundled GitHub skills
(``github-issue-response``, imported from ``.claude/skills``, and
``github-triage``, bundled under ``hub/skills``): loading both permanently
added their combined body to every turn's prompt.

These tests exercise the REAL ``Agent.get_skills_system_prompt`` render path
against the REAL, on-disk ``SKILL.md`` files this repo ships — not a
reimplementation, not a synthetic fixture — through a stub double that never
boots the LLM stack (mirrors ``test_skill_library_tools.py``'s activation
assertions, minus the network-dependent install path).

Assertions are relative (a lazy-inactive-turn prompt is some SMALL fraction of
the legacy prompt), not exact character counts, so this doesn't need updating
every time someone edits prose in the skills' SKILL.md bodies. What must never
regress: (1) a loaded-but-irrelevant skill's body basically disappears, (2)
its name/description survives as a menu line so it stays discoverable, and
(3) the full body comes back the moment the turn is marked as needing it.
