"""Republish the gaia-agent eval's gate verdicts as a GitHub job summary.

Adapted nearly verbatim from ``hub/agents/email/python/packaging/eval_summary.py``
— one reporter shape across agents. The gate manifests under
``tests/fixtures/gaia/`` ship ``enforce: false``, so a BREACHED BAR exits 0 and
produces a green step with no annotation -- the number only exists inside
``eval-out/*.json``, which nobody opens. That is not coverage. This reporter
reads the gate reports the eval already writes and republishes every verdict
into ``$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY``, raising a ``::warning::`` per breach, so an
advisory result still lands in front of a reviewer.

It is a REPORTER, not a gate: it always exits 0. Blocking stays where it belongs
-- ``should_fail`` (= ``enforce`` and not passed), owned by the manifests and
acted on by the gate-report scripts. Flip a manifest's ``enforce`` to true and
that gate blocks; this summary is unaffected either way.

Gate discovery is structural, not a hardcoded list: any ``*_gate`` object
carrying a ``passed`` OR a ``skipped`` key is picked up, at any depth, from any
report file, so a new gate shows up here for free. Both keys matter -- a skipped
gate (``{"skipped": true, "reason": ...}``) has NO ``passed`` field and hardcodes
``should_fail: false`` even under ``enforce: true``, so nothing else in the
pipeline catches it. "We could not measure this" is the one verdict that must
never be rendered as a pass.

Gates in ``GATE_LABELS`` that produce no verdict at all are reported as missing
for the same reason: a step that died before writing its report must not read as
one pass and a silence.
