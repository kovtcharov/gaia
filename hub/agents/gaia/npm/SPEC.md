# `@amd-gaia/gaia` — technical reference

Version **0.1.1**. Companion to [`README.md`](./README.md), which is the
user-facing doc. This file specifies the wire and file formats the package
depends on and the guarantees it makes.

---

## 1. Scope

`@amd-gaia/gaia` is a **binary delivery and process-lifecycle package**. It ships
no agent logic. It owns:

- resolving the host platform to a lock key,
- downloading and **SHA-256 verifying** two published binaries — one from this
  package's own hub lane, one from the `terminal-hub` component's,
- caching them in stable, versioned locations,
- launching the terminal UI, or the agent sidecar directly.

It does **not** own the GAIA daemon's lifecycle, the sidecar's supervision, or
any agent behaviour. See §6 for where those boundaries sit.

---

## 2. `binaries.lock.json`

Ships inside the published package (`files` includes it). It is the single source
of truth for what is downloaded and what it must hash to.

### 2.1 Schema (`schemaVersion` `3.0`)

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": "3.0",
  "agentVersion": "0.1.1",
  "components": {
    "sidecar": {
      "componentVersion": "0.1.1",
      "baseUrl": "https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/gaia/0.1.1",
      "platforms": { "<platformKey>": { /* entry */ } }
    },
    "tui": {
      "componentVersion": "0.23.0",
      "baseUrl": "https://hub.amd-gaia.ai/agents/terminal-hub/0.23.0",
      "platforms": { "<platformKey>": { /* entry */ } }
    }
  }
}
```

A component lane:

| Field              | Type     | Meaning                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `componentVersion` | `string` | That component's own released version                       |
| `baseUrl`          | `string` | Where **that component's** artifacts are served from        |
| `platforms`        | `object` | Platform key → entry                                        |

An entry:

| Field        | Type     | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filename`   | `string` | Artifact name as published under **its component's** `baseUrl` |
| `executable` | `string` | Basename it is written as on disk (with the platform extension) |
| `sha256`     | `string` | Lowercase hex SHA-256 the download must match                |
| `size`       | `number` | Informational. **Not** enforced                              |

**Why per-component, and why `3.0`.** `2.0` had one top-level `baseUrl` shared by
both components. That stopped being true once the TUI became the published
`terminal-hub` component (§2.2): the two live in different hub lanes at different
versions. A shared base URL cannot express that, so `2.x` is rejected at load with
an error naming the schema — never read as `3.x` with a missing field.

The email agent's lock is `schemaVersion` `1.0`, a flat `binaries` map, because it
delivers one binary from one lane. A `1.x`-shaped lock is likewise rejected.

### 2.2 Where each component comes from

| Component | Hub lane                              | Published by            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `sidecar` | `agents/gaia/<agentVersion>/`         | this package's release  |
| `tui`     | `agents/terminal-hub/<componentVersion>/` | the core GAIA release |

The TUI is **consumed, not built here**. It is the same `tui/cmd/gaia` binary the
core release publishes as the `terminal-hub` component and a core install runs as
`gaia tui` — so behaviour is identical by construction rather than by convention.
Building a second copy under this package's lane would put the same bytes at a
different version under a third naming convention, and the two would drift.

The consequence is a real release dependency: this package cannot ship until
`terminal-hub` is published at the version its lock pins. The release fails loudly
naming that version; it never falls back to building its own TUI.

The `tui` lane's origin is pinned in the lock rather than derived from the release
pipeline's hub-origin variable, so the release verifies the exact URL the shipped
lock will send users to. A release pointed at a non-default origin therefore moves
the sidecar lane and **not** the TUI lane; re-point `components.tui.baseUrl` too if
you need both.

### 2.3 Platform keys

`` `${process.platform}-${process.arch}` `` — e.g. `win32-x64`, `darwin-arm64`,
`linux-x64`. This matches `gaia.daemon.sidecars.platform.current_platform_key()`,
which normalises Python's `sys.platform` / `platform.machine()` into the same
namespace so the daemon and this package agree on a cache key.

**The `win32` ↔ `win` mapping.** The `terminal-hub` lane names its Windows
artifacts `gaia-win-x64.exe` / `gaia-win-arm64.exe` (Go's `GOOS` vocabulary), while
our keys come from `process.platform`, which says `win32`. The lock keeps the
`win32-*` key and carries the hub's spelling in `filename`:

| Platform key   | `tui` `filename`         |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `win32-x64`    | `gaia-win-x64.exe`       |
| `win32-arm64`  | `gaia-win-arm64.exe`     |
| `darwin-x64`   | `gaia-darwin-x64`        |
| `darwin-arm64` | `gaia-darwin-arm64`      |
| `linux-x64`    | `gaia-linux-x64`         |
| `linux-arm64`  | `gaia-linux-arm64`       |

The mapping therefore lives in **data**, not in a code path — nothing branches on
the platform to build a name. `TUI_ARTIFACT_NAMES` (in `src/platform.ts` and in
`packaging/gen_binaries_lock.py`) is the authority both the shipped lock and the
release pipeline are checked against, because a wrong name here is not a build
failure anywhere: it is a 404 on a user's first run.

### 2.4 Platform coverage

| Platform key   | `sidecar` | `tui` |
| -------------- | :-------: | :---: |
| `win32-x64`    |    yes    |  yes  |
| `darwin-arm64` |    yes    |  yes  |
| `darwin-x64`   |    yes    |  yes  |
| `linux-x64`    |    yes    |  yes  |
| `linux-arm64`  |  **no**   |  yes  |
| `win32-arm64`  |  **no**   |  yes  |

`terminal-hub` publishes all six. The sidecar is a PyInstaller freeze, produced on
the platform it targets, and there is no arm64 Linux or arm64 Windows freeze.
Resolving `sidecar` on those two keys raises `PlatformError` naming the platform
and the supported set — it is not silently skipped, and the TUI is not launched
without an agent behind it.

### 2.5 Placeholder hashes

Between releases every `sha256` is `PENDING-replace-with-real-sha256`. The release
pipeline regenerates the file with real hashes: for the sidecar, computed from the
artifacts it just published; for the TUI, computed from the `terminal-hub`
artifacts it downloaded and cross-checked against that lane's own recorded hashes
(`agents/terminal-hub/manifest.json`, which the hub computes server-side at publish
time). Both are then re-fetched from the public origin and re-hashed before the
release is allowed to ship.

`isPlaceholderSha()` treats a value as a placeholder when it is all zeros or
contains `PENDING` (case-insensitive). A placeholder **blocks the fetch before any
network call** with a `PlatformError`. There is no flag, env var, or option that
relaxes this.

---

## 3. Integrity

The SHA-256 check is the package's security boundary.

- Downloaded bytes are hashed in memory and compared against the lock **before
  anything is written to the cache path**.
- On mismatch: `IntegrityError`, message naming expected vs actual, nothing left
  on disk.
- Writes go to `<path>.download.<pid>` and are `rename`d into place, so a crash
  mid-write never leaves a partial file that a later run treats as verified.
- A cache hit requires re-hashing the on-disk file and matching the lock.
  A cached file whose bytes drifted is re-downloaded, not reused.
- POSIX installs `chmod 0o755` after the rename.

There is no unverified path, no "warn and continue", and no way to disable the
check.

---

## 4. Filesystem layout

| Component | Default directory              | Executable          |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `sidecar` | `~/.gaia/agents/gaia/`         | `gaia-agent[.exe]`  |
| `tui`     | `~/.gaia/npm-cache/gaia-<agentVersion>/` | `gaia-tui[.exe]` |

The sidecar directory is a **cross-repo contract** with
`gaia.daemon.sidecars.fetch.default_cache_dir("gaia")`. The daemon spawns and
supervises the sidecar and does its own SHA-256 check on the binary it finds
there; installing an already-verified binary at that path turns the daemon's fetch
into a cache hit instead of a second multi-hundred-megabyte download.

### 4.1 The `.installed` sentinel

Installing the sidecar also writes `~/.gaia/agents/gaia/.installed`, the record
the daemon and the TUI both read to answer "is this agent installed?". It is
written on a **cache hit as well as a fresh download**, so an install staged by
an earlier release repairs itself on the next run, and only when the fetch
produced a runnable local install — that is, for the `sidecar` component (the
TUI is not a hub agent) **and** for this host's own platform. A `--platform`
fetch stages a binary for a different host; recording it would hand the daemon a
wrong-architecture executable that re-hashes correctly and then fails to exec.

```json
{
  "id": "gaia",
  "version": "<sidecar componentVersion>",
  "language": "python",
  "installed_at": "<ISO-8601 UTC>",
  "artifact_sha256": "<the verified SHA-256>",
  "path": "<install directory>",
  "artifact_kind": "binary",
  "executable": "gaia-agent[.exe]"
}
```

The shape is a cross-repo contract with `InstalledAgent.to_dict()` in
`gaia.hub.installer`. Three fields are load-bearing:
`gaia.daemon.sidecars.fetch._hub_installed_binary` ignores the install unless
`artifact_kind` is `binary` and `executable` and `artifact_sha256` are non-empty,
and it **re-hashes the binary and raises `IntegrityError` if the file no longer
matches `artifact_sha256`** — so the recorded hash is the one actually verified,
never the lock's nominal value. `executable` must be a bare filename;
`installer.read_sentinel` discards a sentinel whose executable contains a path
separator, which reads as "never installed".

Without the sentinel the daemon sees no install and the TUI falls back to running
`gaia-agent` as its own stdio child — spawning the REST sidecar over stdio and
filling the chat with uvicorn's startup log.

The TUI directory is keyed by `agentVersion` — this package's version, not the
component's — so a bump of either never reuses the previous release's executable.

The TUI executable is renamed to `gaia-tui` on install, **never** `gaia`: the
`terminal-hub` artifact is `gaia-<platform>` and npm installs a `gaia` bin shim on
`PATH`, so keeping the hub's name would shadow the shim. `filename` (what is
downloaded) and `executable` (what is written) are separate fields for exactly this
reason, and `test/lock.test.ts` asserts it for every platform.

Both defaults are overridable (`--sidecar-dir`, `--cache-dir`).

---

## 5. Sidecar HTTP surface

Served by `gaia_agent.server`. Bound to `127.0.0.1` only.

Every request must carry a loopback `Host` header. A `Host` that is non-loopback,
absent or empty is refused with `400` before routing — that check is what defeats
DNS rebinding, so it fails closed rather than serving a request that simply omits
the header.

| Property           | Value                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Default port       | `8141` (`DEFAULT_PORT` in `server.py`)  |
| Reserved port      | `4001` — refused with a `RangeError`    |
| Contract version   | `API_VERSION = "2.12"`                  |
| Agent id / prefix  | `gaia` → `/v1/gaia/...`                 |

### 5.1 Endpoints

| Method | Path                             | Purpose                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/health`                        | Liveness. `{ "status": "ok", "service": "gaia-agent-gaia" }` |
| `GET`  | `/version`                       | Contract probe. `{ "apiVersion", "agentVersion" }` |
| `GET`  | `/v1/gaia/version`               | The TUI's negotiation probe                    |
| `GET`  | `/v1/gaia/init`                  | Readiness detail (Lemonade, model, connectors) |
| `POST` | `/v1/gaia/query`                 | The streaming surface (`text/event-stream`)    |
| `POST` | `/v1/gaia/query/{run_id}/cancel` | Cancel a run by its host-minted `run_id`       |
| `POST` | `/v1/gaia/query/{run_id}/respond`| Answer a mid-run question                      |

`/health` is liveness only. It says nothing about whether Lemonade is up or a
model is loaded — `/v1/gaia/init` answers that.

### 5.2 `session_id` and agent retention

`POST /v1/gaia/query` accepts an optional `session_id` in the request body.
**Pass it on every call in a conversation, and reuse the same value for the
whole conversation.** Contract ≥ 2.12 resolves `session_id` to a *retained*
agent instead of a throwaway built fresh per call — indexed documents and
`load_skill` state only survive between turns when the same `session_id`
threads them together.

A retained skill stays *loaded* but its body is not necessarily in the prompt
every turn: the agent selects per turn which loaded bodies match the query and
collapses the rest to a one-line menu entry (re-activated by calling
`load_skill` again). `GAIA_DYNAMIC_SKILLS=0` disables the selection;
`GAIA_DYNAMIC_SKILLS_TAU=<float>` overrides its threshold; an embedder outage
disables it for the session and every body renders. Omitting it is a valid, explicit one-shot: nothing
persists past that single turn, and the agent is not told otherwise.

A retained session also carries a **project map** — up to 600 prompt tokens of
directory shape, entry points, installed commands and platform quirks, present
whenever the agent's working directory resolves to a code repository (a VCS
directory or a recognised manifest at its root). `GAIA_PROJECT_ROOT=<path>`
picks the project when the working directory is not it. If that repository has
no code index, the first turn starts one in a background thread;
`GAIA_PROJECT_MAP_AUTO_INDEX=0` disables that. Neither affects the wire
contract — they change what the agent knows and what the first turn costs.

A second `/query` for a `session_id` that already has a turn in flight gets
`409 Conflict` — cancel the running turn or wait for it, then retry. A
`/query` that needs a **new** session while every retained slot is busy and
none is idle enough to evict gets `503` with the reason in `detail` — a
temporary, retryable condition, not a bug: wait for a turn to finish (or
close an idle session) and retry. A
`session_id` can also be evicted from the retention table under an idle
timeout (**4 hours** without a turn) or an LRU cap on concurrent sessions
(**100**) — the two knobs that decide when the `503` above can happen at all
(`session_registry.py`). Eviction is idle-only: a conversation still in use is
never timed out mid-flight. A `/query` that lands on an
evicted id gets a fresh agent (the conversation is not blocked) but the
response stream's first event is a `{"type":"status","status":"warning",...}`
telling the caller that per-turn state — most visibly any loaded skill — did
not survive and should be reloaded.

A second `/query` reusing a `run_id` that is still in flight gets `409` —
`run_id` is caller-minted, so mint a fresh UUID per request; reusing one would
leave the earlier run with no way to be cancelled. A `/query` supplying a `model`
that differs from the one its `session_id` was built with also gets `409`: only
agent construction reads a model, so the request cannot be honoured on the
retained agent. Omit `model` to continue on the session's current one, or start a
new `session_id` to switch.

### 5.3 Version gate

`checkVersion()` reads `/version` and compares the **major** of `apiVersion`
against this package's `API_VERSION`. A differing major is a breaking contract
change and raises `VersionMismatchError`. A higher minor with the same major is a
backward-compatible addition and is accepted.

### 5.4 Caller authentication

Loopback binding is not access control: this sidecar exposes shell and file
tools, so an unauthenticated port lets any page the user visits drive it. Three
controls guard it, all in `gaia_agent.caller_auth`, which binds this sidecar's
env-var names and exempt paths onto the shared mechanism in
`gaia.sidecar.caller_auth`:

1. **Per-session bearer token.** Every `/v1/gaia/*` request must carry
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The spawning parent supplies it one of two
   ways: `GAIA_GAIA_SIDECAR_TOKEN_FILE` — the path to a `0600`, owner-only file
   holding the token, which is the preferred channel because the secret never
   sits in the environment — or `GAIA_GAIA_SIDECAR_TOKEN`, the token itself, the
   legacy delivery. A request without it is **401**, with a `detail` naming both
   env vars.
2. **Host allowlist.** The `Host` header must be present *and* loopback
   (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`); anything else — including an absent or
   empty header — is **400**. This is what defeats DNS rebinding, where the
   rebound request arrives with `Host: evil.com`, so it fails closed rather
   than letting a caller opt out by omitting the header.
3. **Origin rejection.** A request carrying a non-loopback browser `Origin` is
   **403**. Non-browser clients send no `Origin` and are unaffected.

`/health`, `/version`, and `/v1/gaia/version` are **token-exempt** — they are
the probes a host polls during the attach handshake, before any token is in
play, and none of them exposes user data or accepts work. Host and Origin still
apply to them, so `waitForHealth` and `checkVersion` work against a
token-protected sidecar without knowing the token.

**Dev mode.** If neither env var is set the token check is skipped and the
sidecar logs a loud warning saying so; Host and Origin are still enforced. That
is the state a sidecar this package spawns comes up in, because `spawnSidecar`
mints nothing — pass your own token through `spawnSidecar`'s `env` option to
turn the check on. The shipped product does not rely on dev mode: the daemon
mints a per-session token and passes it as `GAIA_GAIA_SIDECAR_TOKEN_FILE`
(`gaia.daemon.sidecars.spec` mirrors both names as plain strings so core never
imports this wheel).

### 5.5 Other transports

The HTTP server above is the surface this package drives, and everything in
this document describes it. It is not the agent's only transport:
`gaia_agent.stdio` runs the same agent over newline-delimited JSON on
stdin/stdout — no port, no token, no discovery file. The terminal UI reaches it
that way when it spawns the agent as a subprocess; an agent **installed** from
the hub, which is what this package delivers, is supervised by the daemon over
the HTTP surface above instead (§6.1).

It emits the identical canonical event vocabulary, but its input channel accepts
a JSON line carrying a `gaia_control` key, which gives it something HTTP does
not have: a back-channel that can answer a confirmation prompt *while* a turn is
in flight, and stop that turn (`cancel`) without ending the process — so loaded
skills, "always" grants, history and full access survive a cancel. It also
takes `--full-access` (start with gating off) and
`--use-claude` / `--claude-model` (route chat to the Anthropic API instead of
local Lemonade; embeddings stay on Lemonade either way). None of that is
reachable over `/v1/gaia/query`.

The stdio TUI also supports Local, Fireworks AI, and AMD LLM Gateway through
Lemonade. `/model` lists downloaded local and discovered cloud chat models;
`/model <id>` switches the live client while preserving conversation and skills.
Cloud IDs (`fireworks.*`, `amd.*`) route through Lemonade without local model
loading. Model-state status events identify the provider and remote inference.
The TUI's `/provider` panel configures credentials directly with local Lemonade;
keys never travel through stdio queries. These controls are not exposed over
`/v1/gaia/query`. Lemonade may independently be configured to route a model
remotely, so a local server URL alone does not establish local inference.

---

## 6. Process ownership

Two distinct paths, deliberately:

### 6.1 `gaia run` — the normal path

`run` fetches, verifies, installs, and **execs the TUI**. It does not spawn a
sidecar.

That is not an omission. The TUI reaches agents through the GAIA daemon's relay
(`/v1/<agent>/*`) and holds only the daemon client token, never a sidecar bearer —
`tui/internal/daemon` states this as an invariant. The TUI start-or-attaches the
daemon under an advisory lock, and the daemon spawns and supervises the sidecar
from `~/.gaia/agents/gaia/`. A sidecar spawned here would be a second process the
TUI never talks to, competing for port `8141`.

So `run`'s contribution to the sidecar is putting a **verified** binary where the
daemon looks, and recording the install in `.installed` (§4.1) so the daemon and
the TUI both see it. Daemon and sidecar lifecycle belong to the daemon.

### 6.2 `gaia serve` — the direct path

`serve` fetches the sidecar and spawns it itself, for integrators who want the
REST surface without a daemon or a UI. This path owns the process fully:
port pre-flight → spawn → `waitForHealth` → `checkVersion` → run until
interrupted → tree-kill.

The port is checked **before** the spawn, and a taken port raises
`PortInUseError` without starting anything. That ordering is the guarantee: the
frozen sidecar spends seconds unpacking before it attempts its bind, while an
incumbent answers `/health` in milliseconds — so a post-spawn check alone would
see a healthy port and a still-alive child, and hand back a handle for a server
it does not own. `assertOurs` and the re-probe after a failed health wait remain
as backstops for the narrower window where something binds after the pre-flight.

### 6.3 Tree-kill

The sidecar is a PyInstaller one-file build: it unpacks and spawns a child uvicorn
process that `child.kill()` on the parent does **not** reap, leaving port `8141`
bound. Every teardown kills the whole tree:

- **POSIX** — spawned `detached` so the child leads its own process group;
  `process.kill(-pid, SIGTERM)`, escalating to `SIGKILL` after the timeout.
- **Windows** — `taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F`.

`autoCleanup` (default `true`) also reaps on `exit`, `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`,
`SIGHUP`, `uncaughtException`, and `unhandledRejection`. A `SIGKILL` of the parent
is the one case no in-process handler can catch.

`startSidecar()` shuts the sidecar down before rethrowing on any failure, so a
failed start never leaks a process.

## 7. Exit codes

| Code    | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`     | Success                                                                 |
| `1`     | A typed failure: `IntegrityError`, `PlatformError`, `HealthTimeoutError`, `VersionMismatchError`, `BinaryNotFoundError`, `PortInUseError`, `SidecarExitedError`, `MalformedResponseError`, or an unexpected error |
| `2`     | Usage error: unknown command, invalid `--port`, or a flag the command does not read (`run --port`, `serve --component`, `serve --cache-dir`, `run`/`serve` `--platform`), an unknown `--component`, or a non-https `--base-url` without `--allow-insecure-base-url` |
| *other* | From `run`: the TUI's own exit code, propagated verbatim                 |

A TUI killed by a signal propagates as `128 + signum` (the shell convention), so a
Ctrl+C is distinguishable from a clean `0`.

## 8. Errors

All extend `GaiaError`, so `instanceof GaiaError` catches any of ours.

| Class                  | Raised when                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IntegrityError`       | A download's SHA-256 does not match the lock, or a resolved binary's does not |
| `PlatformError`        | Unsupported platform, missing/incomplete entry, placeholder hash, malformed lock |
| `HealthTimeoutError`   | The sidecar did not report healthy within the timeout          |
| `VersionMismatchError` | `apiVersion` major differs from this package's                 |
| `BinaryNotFoundError`  | A binary is absent from disk when spawning                     |
| `PortInUseError`       | The bind port was already taken; nothing was spawned            |
| `SidecarExitedError`   | The spawned sidecar died while the port answered — something else owns it |
| `HttpError`            | A non-2xx from a sidecar probe                                 |
| `MalformedResponseError` | A 2xx from a sidecar probe whose body is not JSON            |

Per the repo's no-silent-fallbacks rule, every message names what failed, what to
do, and where to look next.

## 9. Timeouts

| Operation             | Default   | Why                                              |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Download (per binary) | `300000`ms | The frozen sidecar is a large artifact           |
| Health wait           | `60000`ms  | A cold one-file build unpacks before it binds    |
| Health poll interval  | `250`ms    |                                                  |
| `/health` probe       | `1000`ms   |                                                  |
| `/version` probe      | `5000`ms   |                                                  |
| Shutdown grace        | `5000`ms   | Then `SIGKILL` / forced                          |

## 10. Public API

Exported from the package root — see `src/index.ts`.

**Fetch:** `fetchAll`, `fetchBinary`, `verifySha256`, `fileSha256`,
`binaryExists`, `defaultCacheDir`, `daemonSidecarCacheDir`,
`INSTALLED_SENTINEL_NAME`, `SIDECAR_AGENT_ID`.

**Lifecycle:** `spawnSidecar`, `startSidecar`, `waitForHealth`, `checkVersion`,
`health`, `version`, `shutdown`, `runTui`, `resolveSidecarPath`, `resolveTuiPath`,
`sidecarExecutableName`, `tuiExecutableName`.

**Platform:** `currentPlatformKey`, `loadLock`, `resolveEntry`, `componentLock`,
`componentBaseUrl`, `platformsFor`, `defaultLockPath`, `isPlaceholderSha`,
`COMPONENTS`, `SCHEMA_MAJOR`, `TUI_ARTIFACT_NAMES`,
`SUPPORTED_SIDECAR_PLATFORMS`, `SUPPORTED_TUI_PLATFORMS`, `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS`.

**Constants:** `AGENT_ID`, `API_VERSION`, `DEFAULT_HOST`, `DEFAULT_PORT`,
`RESERVED_PORT`.

`resolveSidecarPath` / `resolveTuiPath` re-verify the file's SHA-256 against
`binaries.lock.json` before returning a path that is about to be spawned — the
cache path is predictable, so anything able to write it would otherwise get code
run. That makes them **O(size of the binary)**, not a cheap path join: resolve
once at startup, not per request. Pass `{ verify: false }` for a binary you built
yourself, which no lock describes, and `{ lock }` to reuse an already-loaded lock.

## 11. Logging

`DEBUG=gaia` (or `DEBUG=*`) enables debug output. **Everything goes to stderr** —
stdout belongs to the TUI once it is exec'd, and to machine-readable JSON for
`fetch` / `version`.
