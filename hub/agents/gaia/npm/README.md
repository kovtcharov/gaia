# @amd-gaia/gaia

One command gets you a working GAIA:

```bash
npx @amd-gaia/gaia
```

That fetches the two binaries GAIA needs — the agent sidecar and the terminal UI —
verifies both against a checksum manifest that ships inside this package, and drops
you into the terminal UI. No Python to install, no repo to clone, no build step.
Local inference is the default. The TUI can explicitly select Fireworks AI or AMD
LLM Gateway through Lemonade; remote chat sends conversation history to that provider. The
terminal UI's `--use-claude` flag, which would send a conversation to the
Anthropic API, is refused for the agent this package installs — see
[`SPEC.md` §5.5](./SPEC.md#55-other-transports).

The terminal UI you get here is the published **`terminal-hub`** component — the
exact same binary a full GAIA install runs as `gaia tui`, not a separate build. So
however you arrive at the terminal UI, it behaves identically.

## What it actually does

1. **Resolves your platform** — `win32-x64`, `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`,
   `linux-x64` (plus `linux-arm64` / `win32-arm64` for the terminal UI).
2. **Reads `binaries.lock.json`**, the checksum manifest published with this exact
   package version. It records, per binary, which hub lane it comes from and what
   it must hash to.
3. **Downloads and SHA-256 verifies both binaries.** A hash that does not match is
   a hard failure — the download is deleted and the run stops. There is no
   "continue anyway" path and no unverified fallback.
4. **Launches the terminal UI**, which brings up the GAIA daemon and the agent
   sidecar and hands you the chat. Its exit code becomes ours.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (for the built-in `fetch`).
- **[Lemonade Server](https://amd-gaia.ai/docs/reference/dev)** running locally —
  it hosts the model the agent thinks with. GAIA tells you if it isn't up.
- The `gaia` Python CLI **0.23.1 or newer** on `PATH` for the daemon the terminal
  UI starts. Earlier cores start a daemon that has no entry for this agent, so the
  UI comes up with nothing behind it. Install it with
  `curl -fsSL https://amd-gaia.ai/install.sh | sh` (Windows:
  `irm https://amd-gaia.ai/install.ps1 | iex`).

## Supported platforms

The terminal UI is Go and cross-compiles everywhere. The agent sidecar is a frozen
Python build, produced on the machine it targets, and **has no arm64 Linux or arm64
Windows build**. On those two platforms `npx @amd-gaia/gaia` stops with an error
naming your platform and the ones that do work — it will not start a UI with no
agent behind it.

| Platform key   | Agent sidecar | Terminal UI |
| -------------- | :-----------: | :---------: |
| `win32-x64`    |       ✅      |     ✅      |
| `darwin-arm64` |       ✅      |     ✅      |
| `darwin-x64`   |       ✅      |     ✅      |
| `linux-x64`    |       ✅      |     ✅      |
| `linux-arm64`  |       —       |     ✅      |
| `win32-arm64`  |       —       |     ✅      |

`npx @amd-gaia/gaia version` prints this matrix, plus the version and source URL of
each binary, for the release you have installed.

## Commands

```
gaia [run] [options] [-- <tui args>]   Fetch + verify both binaries, then launch the TUI
gaia fetch [options]                   Download + verify only; print JSON and exit
gaia serve [options]                   Run the agent sidecar alone (REST API, no TUI)
gaia version                           Print the lock manifest and this host's platform
gaia help                              Show help
```

Anything after a bare `--` goes to the terminal UI untouched:

```bash
npx @amd-gaia/gaia -- --debug
```

Common options:

| Flag                  | Meaning                                                       | Accepted by |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `--base-url <url>`    | Override the download base URL from `binaries.lock.json`. Must be `https:` | `run`, `fetch`, `serve` |
| `--allow-insecure-base-url` | Permit a non-`https` `--base-url` (a trusted local mirror) | `run`, `fetch`, `serve` |
| `--sidecar-dir <dir>` | Where to install the agent sidecar (default `~/.gaia/agents/gaia`) | `run`, `fetch`, `serve` |
| `--cache-dir <dir>`   | Where to cache the terminal UI binary                          | `run`, `fetch` |
| `--force`             | Re-download even when a verified binary is already cached      | `run`, `fetch`, `serve` |
| `--platform <key>`    | Fetch for another platform                                     | `fetch` |
| `--component <name>`  | Fetch only `sidecar` or `tui`                                  | `fetch` |
| `--port <n>`          | Sidecar bind port (default `8141`)                             | `serve` |

A flag a command does not read is **refused**, not ignored — `gaia run --port
9000` exits 2 rather than silently coming up on the default port.

Set `DEBUG=gaia` for download, spawn, and sidecar output on stderr. Diagnostics
never touch stdout, which the terminal UI owns.

## Where things land

| What            | Path                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Agent sidecar   | `~/.gaia/agents/gaia/gaia-agent[.exe]`   |
| Install record  | `~/.gaia/agents/gaia/.installed`         |
| Terminal UI     | `~/.gaia/npm-cache/gaia-<version>/gaia-tui[.exe]` |

The sidecar goes into the GAIA daemon's own cache directory on purpose: the daemon
is what spawns and supervises it, and it does its own SHA-256 check on the way. By
putting an already-verified binary there we save a second download rather than
racing one.

The `.installed` record next to it is what the daemon and the terminal UI read to
know the agent is installed — without it the UI would run the sidecar as its own
stdio child instead of letting the daemon supervise it. It is rewritten even when
the binary was already cached, so an install left by an earlier version repairs
itself the next time you run. A `--platform` fetch stages a binary for a
*different* machine, so it deliberately leaves no record.

The terminal UI is installed as `gaia-tui`, **never** as `gaia` — a file named
`gaia` in a cache directory would shadow the `gaia` shim npm puts on your `PATH`.

## Ports

| Service       | Port                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Agent sidecar | `8141` on `127.0.0.1`             |
| GAIA daemon   | assigned at start, recorded in `~/.gaia/host/instance.json` |

Port **4001 is reserved repo-wide** and is refused with an error if you pass it.
Both services bind loopback only — this agent speaks for your documents and memory
and has no business on a LAN interface.

## Running the sidecar on its own

`gaia serve` skips the terminal UI and gives you the REST surface directly, for
integrating GAIA into your own app:

```bash
npx @amd-gaia/gaia serve --port 8141
curl http://127.0.0.1:8141/health
```

It waits for `GET /health`, checks the contract version, and tears the whole
process tree down on Ctrl+C. See [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) for the endpoints.

The sidecar normally requires a per-session bearer token on `/v1/gaia/*`, but
neither `serve` nor `startSidecar` mints one, so both leave it in dev mode — the
token check off, `Host`/`Origin` still enforced. This agent has shell and file
tools, so before you expose it to anything, supply a token of your own: see
[`SPEC.md` §5.4](./SPEC.md#54-caller-authentication).

## Programmatic use

```ts
import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto";
import { fetchAll, startSidecar, shutdown } from "@amd-gaia/gaia";

const { sidecar } = await fetchAll();               // both binaries, SHA-256 verified
const proc = await startSidecar({ binaryPath: sidecar.binaryPath });

const sessionId = randomUUID(); // reuse across the whole conversation, see below

const res = await fetch(`${proc.baseUrl}/v1/gaia/query`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "summarize my notes",
    run_id: randomUUID(),
    session_id: sessionId,
    context: [],
  }),
});

await shutdown(proc);
```

`/v1/gaia/query` streams Server-Sent Events terminated by exactly one `final` or
`error`. `fetchAll()` also returns the TUI's path if you would rather launch that.

**Reuse the same `session_id` for every turn in a conversation.** It is what
lets a document you had it index, or a skill you had it load, survive to the
next question — drop it (or mint a new one per call) and the agent still
answers, but it forgets everything from the previous turn. See
[`SPEC.md` §5.2](./SPEC.md#52-session_id-and-agent-retention) for the retry
and eviction behavior.

Every failure throws a typed error (`IntegrityError`, `PlatformError`,
`HealthTimeoutError`, `VersionMismatchError`, `BinaryNotFoundError`) with a message
that names what failed and what to do about it.

## Where the binaries come from

The two binaries ship from two different places, and `binaries.lock.json` records a
version and a source URL for each:

| Binary        | Published as                              | Built by                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Agent sidecar | the `gaia` agent, at this package's version | this package's release           |
| Terminal UI   | the `terminal-hub` component, at its own version | the core GAIA release       |

The terminal UI is **consumed, not rebuilt**. It is byte-for-byte the `gaia tui`
binary a core install ships, so there is no second copy that could lag behind or
behave differently — which is the entire reason it is sourced this way.

## Integrity

`binaries.lock.json` is the single source of truth for what gets downloaded and
what it must hash to. The release pipeline regenerates it from the artifacts
actually being served — the sidecars it just published, and the terminal-hub
artifacts it downloaded and cross-checked against the hub's own recorded hashes.

Between releases the lock carries `PENDING-replace-with-real-sha256` placeholders.
**A placeholder blocks the fetch outright** — before any network call — so an
unverifiable binary can never be downloaded, let alone executed. If you need to run
against a locally built binary, build it yourself and point the lifecycle helpers
at it directly; the fetcher will not be talked into it.

## Container service (Python distribution)

The Python package also ships `gaia-agent --service` (or source-installed `gaia-agent-service`), an opt-in, single-tenant HTTP
worker with required authentication, explicit workspace/Host configuration,
readiness checks and managed embedded Lemonade. This entrypoint is separate from
the npm sidecar lifecycle. See [Container service](../../../../docs/deployment/container-service.mdx)
for image configuration and operational limits. The canonical query contract
remains unchanged; HTTP confirmation-gated tools refuse unless the caller opts into per-call approval.

The frozen binary also supports `gaia-agent --client` for deployed-worker
status, streaming queries, mid-run responses and cancellation. Source installs
expose `gaia-agent-client`; see the container service guide for credentials and examples.
Interactive sensitive answers require hidden terminal input; failed answer delivery
requests cancellation. Socket timeouts must be finite and positive.


### Opt-in HTTP tool approval (contract 2.14)

Send `can_confirm_tools: true` on `/v1/gaia/query` only when the client can show the
complete pending action and `arguments` and collect an explicit decision. A
`needs_confirmation` event then keeps the stream open and includes `confirm_id`.
POST `/v1/gaia/query/{run_id}/confirm` with `{"confirm_id":"…","approved":true}`
to approve that call once, or `false` to deny. Missing, stale, duplicate and
cancelled requests are rejected; there is no always/session grant. Cancellation
or disconnection never approves. The default remains refusal for older callers.
The remote CLI opts in with `--interactive` and defaults its approval prompt to no.

### Container service limits

`--service` bounds HTTP bodies (1 MiB; 413), concurrent agent runs (1; 503 with
`Retry-After: 1`), agent steps (20; 422 above the ceiling), and elapsed time
(300 seconds; terminal SSE error 504). Configure the positive-integer
`GAIA_SERVICE_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`, `GAIA_SERVICE_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`,
`GAIA_SERVICE_MAX_STEPS`, and `GAIA_SERVICE_RUN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` variables.
Cancellation is cooperative: capacity stays occupied until the worker thread
stops. Desktop `--serve` behavior is unchanged. See
`docs/deployment/container-service.mdx` for deployment and regression commands.

The remote CLI omits `max_steps` unless `--max-steps` is supplied, so ordinary
queries use the service's configured default even when its ceiling is below ten.
Explicit values must be positive and within the server ceiling.

### Mounted service inference credentials

Container service mode accepts `LEMONADE_API_KEY_FILE` for an external inference
server and `LEMONADE_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY_FILE` for embedded cloud inference (for
example, `LEMONADE_FIREWORKS_API_KEY_FILE`). Supply either the value or its file,
never both. Files must contain a nonempty UTF-8 token of at most 8 KiB. The value
is resolved at startup and inherited by inference processes; rotate by draining
and restarting the worker. Mounted secrets do not isolate credentials from tools
running in the same worker trust boundary.

### Supervised service preview

The frozen Unix executable accepts `--guardian --config FILE --state DIR
--token-file FILE`. The independent guardian owns an explicitly configured Docker
endpoint, leases one pinned container per execution and verifies termination.
Its controller runs on the same trusted Docker host; this is not a durable-session
API or unrelated-user tenancy. See `docs/spec/service-supervision.mdx` for the
configuration, two authenticated local sockets and qualification limits.

Service mode limits emitted output to 256 KiB/event and 4 MiB/run; overflow emits
a terminal 413 error and cancels the run. Bulk uploads share a 16 MiB buffer budget
and 32-reader limit, with separately reserved control capacity. Persistent volume
disk quotas and host suspend/resume qualification are not claimed by this preview.

## Durable service beta

An optional single-tenant controller uses the separate `/v1/gaia/service` API
(version 1), local SQLite and the independent Docker guardian. Frozen entry points
are `gaia-agent --controller`, `--guardian` and `--durable-client`. Durable runs
survive client disconnects; legacy `/v1/gaia/query` disconnect cancellation is unchanged.
Idempotent submission, bounded replay, generation-scoped interaction receipts,
restart interruption without redispatch, seven-day content retention and offline
full backup/clone restore are described in the [durable service guide](https://amd-gaia.ai/docs/guides/durable-service).
This beta is one trusted deployment, not unrelated-user tenancy or high availability.

The operations candidate adds schema-2 migration with beta rollback backup,
managed artifacts with retryable cleanup, authenticated metrics/drain, bounded
optional content-free traces and explicit incomplete usage. Readiness requires a
configured host-reachable model probe. See [operations](https://amd-gaia.ai/docs/deployment/service-operations)
for qualification and unfulfilled promotion/hardware gates.

### Explicit capability profiles

Declare both `GAIA_SERVICE_EMBEDDING_MODEL` and `GAIA_SERVICE_EMBEDDING_REVISION`
(or guardian `embedding_model`/`embedding_revision`) for prepared embeddings.
`gaia-agent --validate-profile rag --help` exposes the frozen retrieval qualification
CLI. Revision is operator metadata, not verification of remote weights.
Native Linux alone supports the opt-in verified Docker internal-network policy;
Docker Desktop and default networking do not enforce outbound restrictions.
See [capability profiles](https://amd-gaia.ai/deployment/service-profiles) for
qualification commands and unsupported hardware/storage configurations.
